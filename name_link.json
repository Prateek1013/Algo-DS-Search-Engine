Little Petya has n towers consisting of cubes of the same size. Tower with number i consists of ai cubes stacked one on top of the other. Petya defines the instability of a set of towers as a value equal to the difference between the heights of the highest and the lowest of the towers. For example, if Petya built five cube towers with heights (8, 3, 2, 6, 3), the instability of this set is equal to 6 (the highest tower has height 8, the lowest one has height 2). The boy wants the instability of his set of towers to be as low as possible. All he can do is to perform the following operation several times: take the top cube from some tower and put it on top of some other tower of his set. Please note that Petya would never put the cube on the same tower from which it was removed because he thinks it's a waste of time. Before going to school, the boy will have time to perform no more than k such operations. Petya does not want to be late for class, so you have to help him accomplish this task.InputThe first line contains two space-separated positive integers n and k (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u20091000) \u2014 the number of towers in the given set and the maximum number of operations Petya can perform.

The first number is the value of the minimum possible instability that can be obtained after performing at most k operations, the second number is the number of operations needed for that.In the next m lines print the description of each operation as two positive integers i and j, each of them lies within limits from 1 to n. They represent that Petya took the top cube from the i-th tower and put in on the j-th one (i\u2009\u2260\u2009j). Note that in the process of performing operations the heights of some towers can become equal to zero.If there are multiple correct sequences at which the minimum possible instability is achieved, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy3 25 8 5OutputCopy0 22 12 3InputCopy3 42 2 4OutputCopy1 13 2InputCopy5 38 3 2 6 3OutputCopy3 31 31 21 3NoteIn the first sample you need to move the cubes two times, from the second tower to the third one and from the second one to the first one.

Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\nisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree.

And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= code.length <= 500\ncode consists of English letters, digits, '<', '>', '/', '!', '[', ']', '.', and ' '.\n\n"], "592.

(Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.

Effective Approachtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on implementing linear search in an array.According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is.Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the 1-st one (in this problem we consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to n) and ending with the n-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the elements starting from the n-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two approaches are equivalent.To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this, they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and generated m queries of the form: find element with value bi in the array. They want to calculate for both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the second one does, then the winner is Petya.

Shifting Sorttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1\u2026n]=[a1,a2,\u2026,an]a[1\u2026n]=[a1,a2,\u2026,an].This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions:   You may select arbitrary indices ll and rr (1\u2264l<r\u2264n1\u2264l<r\u2264n) as the boundaries of the segment.  Then you replace the segment a[l\u2026r]a[l\u2026r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset dd. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1,4,1,3][1,4,1,3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3,1,4,1][3,1,4,1] to the left by the offset 11 and the sequence [4,1,3,1][4,1,3,1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3,1,4,1][3,1,4,1] to the left by the offset 22. For example, if a=[1,3,2,8,5]a=[1,3,2,8,5], then choosing l=2l=2, r=4r=4 and d=2d=2 yields a segment a[2\u20264]=[3,2,8]a[2\u20264]=[3,2,8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d=2d=2 to the left, and you get a segment [8,3,2][8,3,2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a=[1,8,3,2,5]a=[1,8,3,2,5].Sort the given array aa using no more than nn cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires nn or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1\u2264t\u226410001\u2264t\u22641000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.The next 2t2t lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.

Elements of array aa may repeat and don't have to be unique.OutputPrint tt answers to all input test cases. The first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer kk (0\u2264k\u2264n0\u2264k\u2264n)\u00a0\u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next kk lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"ll\u00a0rr\u00a0dd\" (without quotes) where ll and rr (1\u2264l<r\u2264n1\u2264l<r\u2264n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while dd (1\u2264d\u2264r\u2212l1\u2264d\u2264r\u2212l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset dd to the to the left.Note that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed nn will be accepted.If the given array aa is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k=0k=0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.If there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.ExampleInputCopy4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\nOutputCopy1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\nNoteExplanation of the fourth data set in the example:   The segment a[2\u20264]a[2\u20264] is selected and is shifted to the left by 22: [2,5,1,4,3]\u27f6[2,4,5,1,3][2,5,1,4,3]\u27f6[2,4,5,1,3]  The segment a[1\u20265]a[1\u20265] is then selected and is shifted to the left by 33: [2,4,5,1,3]\u27f6[1,3,2,4,5][2,4,5,1,3]\u27f6[1,3,2,4,5]  After that the segment a[1\u20262]a[1\u20262] is selected and is shifted to the left by 11: [1,3,2,4,5]\u27f6[3,1,2,4,5][1,3,2,4,5]\u27f6[3,1,2,4,5]  And in the end the segment a[1\u20263]a[1\u20263] is selected and is shifted to the left by 11: [3,1,2,4,5]\u27f6[1,2,3,4,5][3,1,2,4,5]\u27f6[1,2,3,4,5] "], "Max and Mex": ["https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1496/B", "B.

The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create artificial rain above each section.Creating artificial rain is an expensive operation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only above one section.

Two subsegments are considered different if at least one bound of those subsegments differs.Note that the subsegments can be equal as sequences but still considered different. For example, consider the sequence (1\u00a01\u00a01\u00a01\u00a01)(1\u00a01\u00a01\u00a01\u00a01) and two of its subsegments: one with l=1l=1 and r=3r=3 and another with l=2l=2 and r=4r=4. Both subsegments are equal to (1\u00a01\u00a01)(1\u00a01\u00a01), but still considered different, as their left and right bounds differ.The scientists want to conduct a reaction to get two different subsegments of the same length.

Also except for the cells (1,11,1) and (n,nn,n) every cell has a value 00 or 11 in it.Before starting his traversal he will pick either a 00 or a 11 and will be able to only go to cells values in which are equal to the digit he chose. The starting and finishing cells (1,11,1) and (n,nn,n) are exempt from this rule, he may go through them regardless of picked digit. Because of this the cell (1,11,1) takes value the letter 'S' and the cell (n,nn,n) takes value the letter 'F'.For example, in the first example test case, he can go from (1,11,1) to (n,nn,n) by using the zeroes on this path: (1,11,1), (2,12,1), (2,22,2), (2,32,3), (3,33,3), (3,43,4), (4,44,4)The rest of the band (Pink Floyd) wants Waters to not be able to do his traversal, so while he is not looking they will invert at most two cells in the grid (from 00 to 11 or vice versa). They are afraid they will not be quick enough and asked for your help in choosing the cells.  Note that you cannot invert cells (1,1)(1,1) and (n,n)(n,n).We can show that there always exists a solution for the given constraints.Also note that Waters will pick his digit of the traversal after the band has changed his grid, so he must not be able to reach (n,nn,n) no matter what digit he picks.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\u2264t\u2264501\u2264t\u226450).

Game on Rangestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob play the following game. Alice has a set SS of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range [1,n][1,n]. In one turn, Alice picks a range [l,r][l,r] from the set SS and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number dd (l\u2264d\u2264rl\u2264d\u2264r). Then Alice removes [l,r][l,r] from SS and puts into the set SS the range [l,d\u22121][l,d\u22121] (if l\u2264d\u22121l\u2264d\u22121) and the range [d+1,r][d+1,r] (if d+1\u2264rd+1\u2264r). The game ends when the set SS is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly nn.After playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges [l,r][l,r] she picked from the set SS, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers dd from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill.Given the list of ranges that Alice has picked ([l,r][l,r]), for each range, help Bob find the number dd that Bob has picked.We can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.InputEach test contains multiple test cases.

Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\u2264n\u226410001\u2264n\u22641000).Each of the next nn lines contains two integers ll and rr (1\u2264l\u2264r\u2264n1\u2264l\u2264r\u2264n), denoting the range [l,r][l,r] that Alice picked at some point.Note that the ranges are given in no particular order.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 10001000, and the ranges for each test case are from a valid game.OutputFor each test case print nn lines. Each line should contain three integers ll, rr, and dd, denoting that for Alice's range [l,r][l,r] Bob picked the number dd.You can print the lines in any order. We can show that the answer is unique.It is not required to print a new line after each test case. The new lines in the output of the example are for readability only.

Alice picked the range [1,3][1,3]. Bob picked the number 11. Then Alice put the range [2,3][2,3] back to the set, which after this turn is the only range in the set.

After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2\u2009>\u20091 and 4\u2009>\u20092), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0\u2009<\u20093 and 1\u2009<\u20095), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion.

Unfortunately, all soldiers died in the war and now the army consists of entirely new recruits, many of whom do not even know from which leg they should begin to march. The civilian population also poorly understands from which leg recruits begin to march, so it is only important how many soldiers march in step.There will be n columns participating in the parade, the i-th column consists of li soldiers, who start to march from left leg, and ri soldiers, who start to march from right leg.The beauty of the parade is calculated by the following formula: if L is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the left leg, and R is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the right leg, so the beauty will equal |L\u2009-\u2009R|.No more than once you can choose one column and tell all the soldiers in this column to switch starting leg, i.e. everyone in this columns who starts the march from left leg will now start it from right leg, and vice versa. Formally, you can pick no more than one index i and swap values li and ri. Find the index of the column, such that switching the starting leg for soldiers in it will maximize the the beauty of the parade, or determine, that no such operation can increase the current beauty.InputThe first line contains single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of columns.

In this case the beauty of the parade will equal |23\u2009-\u200918|\u2009=\u20095.If you give the order to change the leg to the third column, so the number of soldiers, who march from the left leg, will equal 5\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20093\u2009=\u200916, and who march from the right leg\u00a0\u2014 6\u2009+\u20099\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u200925.

It is guaranteed that each opening parenthesis has a succeeding closing parenthesis. Similarly, each closing parentheses has a preceding opening parentheses matching it. For each pair of matching parentheses there are no other parenthesis between them. In other words, each parenthesis in the string belongs to a matching \"opening-closing\" pair, and such pairs can't be nested.For example, the following string is valid: \"_Hello_Vasya(and_Petya)__bye_(and_OK)\".Word is a maximal sequence of consecutive letters, i.e. such sequence that the first character to the left and the first character to the right of it is an underscore, a parenthesis, or it just does not exist. For example, the string above consists of seven words: \"Hello\", \"Vasya\", \"and\", \"Petya\", \"bye\", \"and\" and \"OK\". Write a program that finds:  the length of the longest word outside the parentheses (print 0, if there is no word outside the parentheses),  the number of words inside the parentheses (print 0, if there is no word inside the parentheses). InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009255)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the given string. The second line contains the string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase English letters, parentheses and underscore symbols.

After the playing the card is discarded.More formally: let's say that there is a counter of the cards that can be played. At the beginning of the round the counter equals one. When a card is played, the counter decreases by one for the played card and increases by the number bi, which is written at the bottom of the card. Then the played card is discarded. If after that the counter is not equal to zero, the player gets the opportunity to play another card from the remaining cards.

He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (r,\u2009c) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically.  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally.  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally.   The pieces move like that Petya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (r1,\u2009c1) to field (r2,\u2009c2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.InputThe input contains four integers r1,\u2009c1,\u2009r2,\u2009c2 (1\u2009\u2264\u2009r1,\u2009c1,\u2009r2,\u2009c2\u2009\u2264\u20098) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and the final field.

One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.InputThe input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters.

Tonight there will be a chest with brains on display and every attendee sees how many there are. These will then be split among the attendees according to the following procedure:The zombie of the highest rank makes a suggestion on who gets how many brains (every brain is an indivisible entity). A vote follows. If at least half of the attendees accept the offer, the brains are shared in the suggested way and the feast begins. But if majority is not reached, then the highest-ranked zombie is killed, and the next zombie in hierarchy has to make a suggestion. If he is killed too, then the third highest-ranked makes one, etc. (It's enough to have exactly half of the votes \u2013 in case of a tie, the vote of the highest-ranked alive zombie counts twice, and he will of course vote in favor of his own suggestion in order to stay alive.)You should know that zombies are very greedy and sly, and they know this too \u2013 basically all zombie brains are alike. Consequently, a zombie will never accept an offer which is suboptimal for him. That is, if an offer is not strictly better than a potential later offer, he will vote against it. And make no mistake: while zombies may normally seem rather dull, tonight their intellects are perfect. Each zombie's priorities for tonight are, in descending order:   survive the event (they experienced death already once and know it is no fun),  get as many brains as possible. Heidi goes first and must make an offer which at least half of the attendees will accept, and which allocates at least one brain for Heidi herself.What is the smallest number of brains that have to be in the chest for this to be possible?InputThe only line of input contains one integer: N, the number of attendees (1\u2009\u2264\u2009N\u2009\u2264\u2009109).OutputOutput one integer: the smallest number of brains in the chest which allows Heidi to take one brain home.ExamplesInputCopy1OutputCopy1InputCopy4OutputCopy2Note"], "Special Task": ["https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/316/A2", "A2.

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. The content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.And he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. For example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".After receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.At a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

For example, if we do 44 operations: take b1b1, then bmbm, then bm\u22121bm\u22121 and at last b2b2, then bb becomes [b3,b4,\u2026,bm\u22123][b3,b4,\u2026,bm\u22123] and c=[b1,bm,bm\u22121,b2]c=[b1,bm,bm\u22121,b2].Consider the following example: b=[1,2,3,4,4,2,1]b=[1,2,3,4,4,2,1]. This array is good because we can obtain non-decreasing array cc from it by the following sequence of operations:  take the first element of bb, so b=[2,3,4,4,2,1]b=[2,3,4,4,2,1], c=[1]c=[1];  take the last element of bb, so b=[2,3,4,4,2]b=[2,3,4,4,2], c=[1,1]c=[1,1];  take the last element of bb, so b=[2,3,4,4]b=[2,3,4,4], c=[1,1,2]c=[1,1,2];  take the first element of bb, so b=[3,4,4]b=[3,4,4], c=[1,1,2,2]c=[1,1,2,2];  take the first element of bb, so b=[4,4]b=[4,4], c=[1,1,2,2,3]c=[1,1,2,2,3];  take the last element of bb, so b=[4]b=[4], c=[1,1,2,2,3,4]c=[1,1,2,2,3,4];  take the only element of bb, so b=[]b=[], c=[1,1,2,2,3,4,4]c=[1,1,2,2,3,4,4]\u00a0\u2014 cc is non-decreasing.

Polycarp likes trees more than permutations, so he wants to transform permutation aa into a rooted binary tree. He transforms an array of different integers into a tree as follows:   the maximum element of the array becomes the root of the tree;  all elements to the left of the maximum \u2014 form a left subtree (which is built according to the same rules but applied to the left part of the array), but if there are no elements to the left of the maximum, then the root has no left child;  all elements to the right of the maximum \u2014 form a right subtree (which is built according to the same rules but applied to the right side of the array), but if there are no elements to the right of the maximum, then the root has no right child. For example, if he builds a tree by permutation a=[3,5,2,1,4]a=[3,5,2,1,4], then the root will be the element a2=5a2=5, and the left subtree will be the tree that will be built for the subarray a[1\u20261]=[3]a[1\u20261]=[3], and the right one \u2014 for the subarray a[3\u20265]=[2,1,4]a[3\u20265]=[2,1,4]. As a result, the following tree will be built:   The tree corresponding to the permutation a=[3,5,2,1,4]a=[3,5,2,1,4]. Another example: let the permutation be a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]. In this case, the tree looks like this:   The tree corresponding to the permutation a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4].

The ii-th attack is performed at the beginning of the aiai-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 11 damage during each of the next kk seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).For example, suppose k=4k=4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 22, 44 and 1010. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 22-nd second and deals 11 damage during the 22-nd and 33-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 44-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 11 damage during the seconds 44, 55, 66 and 77; then, during the 1010-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 11 damage during the seconds 1010, 1111, 1212 and 1313.

For example, the following sequences of instructions are considered valid: \"UD\", \"RL\", \"UUURULLDDDDLDDRRUU\", and the following are considered invalid: \"U\" (the endpoint is not (0,0)(0,0)) and \"UUDD\" (the cell (0,1)(0,1) is visited twice).The initial sequence of instructions, however, might be not valid. You don't want your robot to break so you decided to reprogram it in the following way: you will remove some (possibly, all or none) instructions from the initial sequence of instructions, then rearrange the remaining instructions as you wish and turn on your robot to move. Your task is to remove as few instructions from the initial sequence as possible and rearrange the remaining ones so that the sequence is valid. Report the valid sequence of the maximum length you can obtain.Note that you can choose any order of remaining instructions (you don't need to minimize the number of swaps or any other similar metric).You have to answer qq independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer qq (1\u2264q\u22642\u22c51041\u2264q\u22642\u22c5104) \u2014 the number of test cases.The next qq lines contain test cases. The ii-th test case is given as the string ss consisting of at least 11 and no more than 105105 characters 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D' \u2014 the initial sequence of instructions.It is guaranteed that the sum of |s||s| (where |s||s| is the length of ss) does not exceed 105105 over all test cases (\u2211|s|\u2264105\u2211|s|\u2264105).OutputFor each test case print the answer on it. In the first line print the maximum number of remaining instructions. In the second line print the valid sequence of remaining instructions tt the robot has to perform. The moves are performed from left to right in the order of the printed sequence. If there are several answers, you can print any. If the answer is 00, you are allowed to print an empty line (but you can don't print it).ExampleInputCopy6\nLRU\nDURLDRUDRULRDURDDL\nLRUDDLRUDRUL\nLLLLRRRR\nURDUR\nLLL\nOutputCopy2\nLR\n14\nRUURDDDDLLLUUR\n12\nULDDDRRRUULL\n2\nLR\n2\nUD\n0\n\nNoteThere are only two possible answers in the first test case: \"LR\" and \"RL\".The picture corresponding to the second test case:  Note that the direction of traverse does not matter Another correct answer to the third test case: \"URDDLLLUURDR\"."], "Square Filling": ["https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1207/B", "B.

More specifically, he wants a bracket sequence so complex that no matter how hard he tries, he will not be able to remove a simple subsequence!We say that a string formed by nn characters '(' or ')' is simple if its length nn is even and positive, its first n2n2 characters are '(', and its last n2n2 characters are ')'. For example, the strings () and (()) are simple, while the strings )( and ()() are not simple.Kuroni will be given a string formed by characters '(' and ')' (the given string is not necessarily simple). An operation consists of choosing a subsequence of the characters of the string that forms a simple string and removing all the characters of this subsequence from the string. Note that this subsequence doesn't have to be continuous. For example, he can apply the operation to the string ')()(()))', to choose a subsequence of bold characters, as it forms a simple string '(())', delete these bold characters from the string and to get '))()'. Kuroni has to perform the minimum possible number of operations on the string, in such a way that no more operations can be performed on the remaining string. The resulting string does not have to be empty.Since the given string is too large, Kuroni is unable to figure out how to minimize the number of operations. Can you help him do it instead?A sequence of characters aa is a subsequence of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.InputThe only line of input contains a string ss (1\u2264|s|\u226410001\u2264|s|\u22641000) formed by characters '(' and ')', where |s||s| is the length of ss.OutputIn the first line, print an integer kk \u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations you have to apply. Then, print 2k2k lines describing the operations in the following format:For each operation, print a line containing an integer mm \u00a0\u2014 the number of characters in the subsequence you will remove.Then, print a line containing mm integers 1\u2264a1<a2<\u22ef<am1\u2264a1<a2<\u22ef<am \u00a0\u2014 the indices of the characters you will remove. All integers must be less than or equal to the length of the current string, and the corresponding subsequence must form a simple string.If there are multiple valid sequences of operations with the smallest kk, you may print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy(()((\nOutputCopy1\n2\n1 3 \nInputCopy)(\nOutputCopy0\nInputCopy(()())\nOutputCopy1\n4\n1 2 5 6 \nNoteIn the first sample, the string is '(()(('.

A tree with nn nodes is an connected undirected graph with nn nodes and n\u22121n\u22121 edges. Note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once.Here is an example of a tree:   A restriction consists of 33 pairwise distinct integers, aa, bb, and cc (1\u2264a,b,c\u2264n1\u2264a,b,c\u2264n).

This point TT is the same for all clues.In other words, each clue belongs to exactly one of the obelisks, and each obelisk has exactly one clue that belongs to it.

However, both obelisks must give the same location, hence this is clearly not the correct permutation.If the hidden permutation is [2,1][2,1], then the first clue belongs to the second obelisk and the second clue belongs to the first obelisk.

The length of the replaced substring is calculated as following: write down all the changed positions. If there are none, then the length is 00.

For example, the length of the changed substring between the passwords \"abcdef\" \u2192\u2192 \"a7cdEf\" is 44, because the changed positions are 22 and 55, thus (5\u22122)+1=4(5\u22122)+1=4.It is guaranteed that such a password always exists.If there are several suitable passwords \u2014 output any of them.ExampleInputCopy2abcDCEhtQw27OutputCopyabcD4EhtQw27NoteIn the first example Vasya's password lacks a digit, he replaces substring \"C\" with \"4\" and gets password \"abcD4E\".

Lets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (r,\u2009c) the cell located at the row r and at the column c.There are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.Player A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.Moving upward means that the pawn located in (r,\u2009c) will go to the cell (r\u2009-\u20091,\u2009c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r,\u2009c) will go to the cell (r\u2009+\u20091,\u2009c). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.Given the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game scenario both players will have some moves available.InputThe input consists of the board description given in eight lines, each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black pawn, and character 'W' represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'. It's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first row neither black pawns on the last row.OutputPrint 'A' if player A wins the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner on the given board.ExamplesInputCopy.................B....B.....W.............W.....................OutputCopyAInputCopy..B.......W...........B..............W........B.................OutputCopyBNoteIn the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3 steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4,\u20095). Player B needs at least 5 steps for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."], "Inna and New Matrix of Candies": ["https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/400/B", "B.

Each line of the table contains one cell with a dwarf figurine, one cell with a candy, the other cells of the line are empty. The game lasts for several moves. During each move the player should choose all lines of the matrix where dwarf is not on the cell with candy and shout \"Let's go!\". After that, all the dwarves from the chosen lines start to simultaneously move to the right. During each second, each dwarf goes to the adjacent cell that is located to the right of its current cell. The movement continues until one of the following events occurs:  some dwarf in one of the chosen lines is located in the rightmost cell of his row;  some dwarf in the chosen lines is located in the cell with the candy. The point of the game is to transport all the dwarves to the candy cells.Inna is fabulous, as she came up with such an interesting game. But what about you?

The computer network of this corporation consists of n computers, some of them are connected by a cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to n. It's known that any two computers connected by cable directly or through other computersPolycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices.Polycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the topology where all computers of a network are connected to the single central node.Let's represent each of these network topologies as a connected non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph, where a single central node is singled out and connected with all other nodes.

However, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer.The King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format are as follows:   A number contains the integer part and the fractional part. The two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point).  To make digits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into groups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups are separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part of a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as 12,345,678  In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain exactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted into the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional part (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its length equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the extra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests).  When a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not written. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is written in round brackets.  Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away operates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes ($), that's why right before the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"$\". If the number should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be inside the brackets. For example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored in the financial format as \"$2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be stored as \"($12,345,678.90)\".The merchants of Far Far Away visited you again and expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert arbitrary numbers to the financial format.

The number's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible) signs \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point).

The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded and followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits  A number cannot start with digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in this case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\").  The minus sign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the number's notation  If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is written as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus sign.  The input data contains no spaces.  The number's notation contains at least one decimal digit.

Two rounds, Div1 and Div2, can go simultaneously, (Div1 round cannot be held without Div2) in all other cases the rounds don't overlap in time. Each round has a unique identifier \u2014 a positive integer. The rounds are sequentially (without gaps) numbered with identifiers by the starting time of the round. The identifiers of rounds that are run simultaneously are different by one, also the identifier of the Div1 round is always greater.Sereja is a beginner coder, so he can take part only in rounds of Div2 type. At the moment he is taking part in a Div2 round, its identifier equals to x. Sereja remembers very well that he has taken part in exactly k rounds before this round. Also, he remembers all identifiers of the rounds he has taken part in and all identifiers of the rounds that went simultaneously with them.

The competition is one of the most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.Each mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part lasts t1 seconds and the second part lasts t2 seconds. The first and the second part are separated by a little break.After the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of vi meters per second. After t1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is reduced by k percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of ui meters per second. After a t2 seconds after the end of the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the break may vary.Before the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds ai and bi, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed ai before the break and speed bi after it, or vice versa.Dwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the mushroom.

On each training session all the n soldiers are present.At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is formed.

The sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are blooming, and their Potions class teacher, professor Snipe is sulky as usual. Due to his angst fueled by disappointment in his own life, he has given them a lot of homework in Potions class. Each of the n students has been assigned a single task. Some students do certain tasks faster than others. Thus, they want to redistribute the tasks so that each student still does exactly one task, and that all tasks are finished. Each student has their own laziness level, and each task has its own difficulty level. Professor Snipe is trying hard to improve their work ethics, so each student\u2019s laziness level is equal to their task\u2019s difficulty level.

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads \u2014 major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z \u2014 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F \u2014 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.InputThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.OutputPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor.

Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are \"relaxing\".For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap).It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again. Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative.

In other words, all p[i] are different. It is possible that the group also has some really \"special individuals\" for who i\u2009=\u2009p[i].Each student wrote exactly one notebook of lecture notes. We know that the students agreed to act by the following algorithm:   on the first day of revising each student studies his own Mathematical Analysis notes,  in the morning of each following day each student gives the notebook to his best friend and takes a notebook from the student who calls him the best friend. Thus, on the second day the student p[i] (1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009n) studies the i-th student's notes, on the third day the notes go to student p[p[i]] and so on.

The size of the ii-th candy is aiai.Alice and Bob play an interesting and tasty game: they eat candy. Alice will eat candy from left to right, and Bob \u2014 from right to left. The game ends if all the candies are eaten.The process consists of moves. During a move, the player eats one or more sweets from her/his side (Alice eats from the left, Bob \u2014 from the right).Alice makes the first move. During the first move, she will eat 11 candy (its size is a1a1). Then, each successive move the players alternate \u2014 that is, Bob makes the second move, then Alice, then again Bob and so on.On each move, a player counts the total size of candies eaten during the current move. Once this number becomes strictly greater than the total size of candies eaten by the other player on their previous move, the current player stops eating and the move ends. In other words, on a move, a player eats the smallest possible number of candies such that the sum of the sizes of candies eaten on this move is strictly greater than the sum of the sizes of candies that the other player ate on the previous move. If there are not enough candies to make a move this way, then the player eats up all the remaining candies and the game ends.For example, if n=11n=11 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5], then:  move 1: Alice eats one candy of size 33 and the sequence of candies becomes [1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5][1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5].  move 2: Alice ate 33 on the previous move, which means Bob must eat 44 or more. Bob eats one candy of size 55 and the sequence of candies becomes [1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3][1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3].  move 3: Bob ate 55 on the previous move, which means Alice must eat 66 or more. Alice eats three candies with the total size of 1+4+1=61+4+1=6 and the sequence of candies becomes [5,9,2,6,5,3][5,9,2,6,5,3].  move 4: Alice ate 66 on the previous move, which means Bob must eat 77 or more. Bob eats two candies with the total size of 3+5=83+5=8 and the sequence of candies becomes [5,9,2,6][5,9,2,6].  move 5: Bob ate 88 on the previous move, which means Alice must eat 99 or more. Alice eats two candies with the total size of 5+9=145+9=14 and the sequence of candies becomes [2,6][2,6].  move 6 (the last): Alice ate 1414 on the previous move, which means Bob must eat 1515 or more.

Reaching its gates was uneasy, but passing through them proved to be even more challenging. Mostly because of Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades. Orpheus, a famous poet, and musician plans to calm Cerberus with his poetry and safely walk past him. He created a very peculiar poem for Cerberus. It consists only of lowercase English letters. We call a poem's substring a palindrome if and only if it reads the same backwards and forwards. A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deleting several (possibly zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) characters from the end.Unfortunately, Cerberus dislikes palindromes of length greater than 11. For example in the poem abaa the hound of Hades wouldn't like substrings aba and aa.Orpheus can only calm Cerberus if the hound likes his poetry. That's why he wants to change his poem so that it does not contain any palindrome substrings of length greater than 11.Orpheus can modify the poem by replacing a letter at any position with any lowercase English letter. He can use this operation arbitrarily many times (possibly zero). Since there can be many palindromes in his poem, he may have to make some corrections. But how many, exactly?

One bucket of paint can paint exactly one seat.  After Tina has painted kk seats in the previous step, Rahul chooses where he sits. He will not choose a seat that has been painted pink due to his hatred of the colour pink.  After Rahul has chosen his seat, Tina chooses a seat for herself. She can choose any of the seats, painted or not, other than the one chosen by Rahul. Rahul wants to choose a seat such that he sits as close to Tina as possible. However, Tina wants to sit as far away from Rahul as possible due to some complicated relationship history that we couldn't fit into the statement!Now, Rahul wonders for k=0,1,\u2026,n\u22c5m\u22121k=0,1,\u2026,n\u22c5m\u22121, if Tina has kk buckets of paint, how close can Rahul sit to Tina, if both Rahul and Tina are aware of each other's intentions and they both act as strategically as possible?

Rahul chooses the seat at (3,1)(3,1) after which Tina chooses to sit at (1,3)(1,3). Therefore, the distance between Tina and Rahul is |3\u22121|+|1\u22123|=4|3\u22121|+|1\u22123|=4, and we can prove that this is indeed the minimum possible distance under the given constraints. There may be other choices of seats which lead to the same answer as well.For k=0k=0 in the first test case, Rahul can decide to sit at (2,2)(2,2) and Tina can decide to sit at (4,3)(4,3) so the distance between them would be |2\u22124|+|2\u22123|=3|2\u22124|+|2\u22123|=3.Below are pictorial representations of the k=3k=3 and k=0k=0 cases for the first test case.

If k=3k=3, it's impossible to make all aiai equal to 00. After performing the first operation, we'll get three elements equal to 00 and one equal to 44. After that, all elimination operations won't change anything, since at least one chosen element will always be equal to 00.

Scientists from all over the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim that this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more reasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to actually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures are.Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat intensity value. This value is calculated as follows:Suppose we want to analyze the segment of nn consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these nn days; the temperature during ii-th day equals aiai.We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day xx to day yy, we calculate it as \u2211i=xyaiy\u2212x+1\u2211i=xyaiy\u2212x+1 (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than kk consecutive days.

This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day ki products will be put up for sale and exactly li clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale ki products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2\u00b7ki products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.InputThe first line contains two integers n and f (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009105,\u20090\u2009\u2264\u2009f\u2009\u2264\u2009n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers ki,\u2009li (0\u2009\u2264\u2009ki,\u2009li\u2009\u2264\u2009109) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.OutputPrint a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.ExamplesInputCopy4 22 13 52 31 5OutputCopy10InputCopy4 10 20 33 50 6OutputCopy5NoteIn the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out.

As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.Assume that we have a cat with a number xx. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal 2m\u221212m\u22121 for some non-negative integer mm. For example, the numbers 00, 11, 33, 77, 1515 and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on xx:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer nn and replace xx with x\u2295(2n\u22121)x\u2295(2n\u22121), with \u2295\u2295 being a bitwise XOR operator.

Vertical Pathstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted tree consisting of nn vertices. Vertices are numbered from 11 to nn. Any vertex can be the root of a tree.A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root.The tree is specified by an array of parents pp containing nn numbers: pipi is a parent of the vertex with the index ii. The parent of a vertex uu is a vertex that is the next vertex on the shortest path from uu to the root. For example, on the simple path from 55 to 33 (the root), the next vertex would be 11, so the parent of 55 is 11.The root has no parent, so for it, the value of pipi is ii (the root is the only vertex for which pi=ipi=i).Find such a set of paths that:  each vertex belongs to exactly one path, each path can contain one or more vertices;  in each path each next vertex\u00a0\u2014 is a son of the current vertex (that is, paths always lead down\u00a0\u2014 from parent to son);  number of paths is minimal.

Count the number of balanced subtrees.A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root. In this problem, all trees have root 11.The tree is specified by an array of parents a2,\u2026,ana2,\u2026,an containing n\u22121n\u22121 numbers: aiai is the parent of the vertex with the number ii for all i=2,\u2026,ni=2,\u2026,n. The parent of a vertex uu is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from uu to the root.The subtree of a vertex uu is the set of all vertices that pass through uu on a simple path to the root. For example, in the picture below, 77 is in the subtree of 33 because the simple path 7\u21925\u21923\u219217\u21925\u21923\u21921 passes through 33. Note that a vertex is included in its subtree, and the subtree of the root is the entire tree.  The picture shows the tree for n=7n=7, a=[1,1,2,3,3,5]a=[1,1,2,3,3,5], and s=WBBWWBWs=WBBWWBW.

Naturally he is facing the problem of choosing a programming language. After long considerations he realized that Java is the best choice. The main argument in favor of choosing Java was that it has a very large integer data type, called BigInteger.But having attended several classes of the club, Petya realized that not all tasks require using the BigInteger type. It turned out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types. That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer n?\"Petya knows only 5 integer types:1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from \u2009-\u2009128 to 1272) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from \u2009-\u200932768 to 327673) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from \u2009-\u20092147483648 to 21474836474) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from \u2009-\u20099223372036854775808 to 92233720368547758075) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.For all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.From this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer n. Since BigInteger works much slower, Peter regards it last. Help him.InputThe first line contains a positive number n. It consists of no more than 100 digits and doesn't contain any leading zeros.

But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: \"How did he do that?\" The answer is simple.Vasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular n\u2009\u00d7\u2009m field. The squares have coordinates (x,\u2009y) (1\u2009\u2264\u2009x\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u20091\u2009\u2264\u2009y\u2009\u2264\u2009m), where x is the index of the row and y is the index of the column.Initially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (xc,\u2009yc). To play, he has got a list of k vectors (dxi,\u2009dyi) of non-zero length. The game goes like this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to k, and consecutively chooses each vector as the current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).A step is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square (x,\u2009y), and the current vector is (dx,\u2009dy), one step moves Vasya to square (x\u2009+\u2009dx,\u2009y\u2009+\u2009dy). A step is considered valid, if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step.Vasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in his list.

All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length.

To make managing easier, their owners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only possible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies, merge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company left.But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect unfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum salaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum salaries are equal.To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can change salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists on two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the employees in one company must get the same increase.Sure enough, the owners want to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies.

The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.Unfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.Now the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.Shapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said:   As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin.  As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs.  The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600  My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes.  Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN  You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong.

The description somehow resembles the one you usually see in real operating systems. However, there are differences in the behavior. Please make sure you've read the statement attentively and use it as a formal document.In the Pindows operating system a strings are the lexemes of the command line \u2014 the first of them is understood as the name of the program to run and the following lexemes are its arguments. For example, as we execute the command \" run.exe one, two . \", we give four lexemes to the Pindows command line: \"run.exe\", \"one,\", \"two\", \".\". More formally, if we run a command that can be represented as string s (that has no quotes), then the command line lexemes are maximal by inclusion substrings of string s that contain no spaces.To send a string with spaces or an empty string as a command line lexeme, we can use double quotes. The block of characters that should be considered as one lexeme goes inside the quotes. Embedded quotes are prohibited \u2014 that is, for each occurrence of character \"\"\" we should be able to say clearly that the quotes are opening or closing. For example, as we run the command \"\"run.exe o\" \"\" \" ne, \" two . \" \" \", we give six lexemes to the Pindows command line: \"run.exe o\", \"\" (an empty string), \" ne, \", \"two\", \".\", \" \" (a single space).It is guaranteed that each lexeme of the command line is either surrounded by spaces on both sides or touches the corresponding command border. One of its consequences is: the opening brackets are either the first character of the string or there is a space to the left of them.You have a string that consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits, characters \".,?!\"\" and spaces. It is guaranteed that this string is a correct OS Pindows command line string. Print all lexemes of this command line string. Consider the character \"\"\" to be used only in order to denote a single block of characters into one command line lexeme. In particular, the consequence is that the given string has got an even number of such characters.InputThe single line contains a non-empty string s. String s consists of at most 105 characters. Each character is either an uppercase or a lowercase English letter, or a digit, or one of the \".,?!\"\" signs, or a space.It is guaranteed that the given string is some correct command line string of the OS Pindows. It is guaranteed that the given command line string contains at least one lexeme.OutputIn the first line print the first lexeme, in the second line print the second one and so on. To make the output clearer, print the \"<\" (less) character to the left of your lexemes and the \">\" (more) character to the right.

Processing i-th element of the array is done in three steps:1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0.2. The i-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256.3.

Some people are in charge of the daily watering of flowers in shifts according to the schedule. However when Marina Sergeyevna was making the schedule, she was so tired from work and so lost in dreams of the oncoming vacation that she perhaps made several mistakes. In fact, it is possible that according to the schedule, on some days during the holidays the flowers will not be watered or will be watered multiple times.

Brain Network (easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of n brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly:   It should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains).  There should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false. If both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20091000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to n) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock.

There is no middle ground.Cersei Lannister, A Game of Thrones by George R.\u00a0R. MartinThere are nn nobles, numbered from 11 to nn. Noble ii has a power of ii. There are also mm \"friendships\". A friendship between nobles aa and bb is always mutual.A noble is defined to be vulnerable if both of the following conditions are satisfied:   the noble has at least one friend, and  all of that noble's friends have a higher power. You will have to process the following three types of queries.   Add a friendship between nobles uu and vv.  Remove a friendship between nobles uu and vv.  Calculate the answer to the following process. The process: all vulnerable nobles are simultaneously killed, and all their friendships end. Then, it is possible that new nobles become vulnerable. The process repeats itself until no nobles are vulnerable. It can be proven that the process will end in finite time. After the process is complete, you need to calculate the number of remaining nobles.Note that the results of the process are not carried over between queries, that is, every process starts with all nobles being alive!InputThe first line contains the integers nn and mm (1\u2264n\u22642\u22c51051\u2264n\u22642\u22c5105, 0\u2264m\u22642\u22c51050\u2264m\u22642\u22c5105) \u2014 the number of nobles and number of original friendships respectively.The next mm lines each contain the integers uu and vv (1\u2264u,v\u2264n1\u2264u,v\u2264n, u\u2260vu\u2260v), describing a friendship.

In the first type 3 query, we have the diagram below.In the first round of the process, noble 11 is weaker than all of his friends (22 and 33), and is thus killed. No other noble is vulnerable in round 1. In round 2, noble 33 is weaker than his only friend, noble 44, and is therefore killed. At this point, the process ends, and the answer is 22.  In the second type 3 query, the only surviving noble is 44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second example consists of only one type 33 query. In the first round, two nobles are killed, and in the second round, one noble is killed. The final answer is 11, since only one noble survives.

When you pronounce letters, the machine will inscribe them onto a piece of paper. For example, if you pronounce 'c', 'o', 'd', and 'e' in that order, then the machine will inscribe \"code\" onto the paper. Thanks to this machine, she can finally write messages without using her glasses.However, her dumb friend Akko decided to play a prank on her. Akko tinkered with the machine so that if you pronounce 'w', it will inscribe \"uu\" instead of \"w\", and if you pronounce 'm', it will inscribe \"nn\" instead of \"m\"! Since Constanze had bad eyesight, she was not able to realize what Akko did.The rest of the letters behave the same as before: if you pronounce any letter besides 'w' and 'm', the machine will just inscribe it onto a piece of paper.The next day, I received a letter in my mailbox. I can't understand it so I think it's either just some gibberish from Akko, or Constanze made it using her machine. But since I know what Akko did, I can just list down all possible strings that Constanze's machine would have turned into the message I got and see if anything makes sense.But I need to know how much paper I will need, and that's why I'm asking you for help.

More formally, Polycarp adds the value of aiai to ai\u22121ai\u22121 or to ai+1ai+1 (if such a neighbor does not exist, then it is impossible to add to it).  After adding it, Polycarp removes the ii-th element from the aa array. During this step the length of aa is decreased by 11. The two items above together denote one single operation.For example, if Polycarp has an array a=[3,1,6,6,2]a=[3,1,6,6,2], then it can perform the following sequence of operations with it:   Polycarp selects i=2i=2 and adds the value aiai to (i\u22121)(i\u22121)-th element: a=[4,6,6,2]a=[4,6,6,2].

The machine supports two kinds of operations:  Increase all elements of a suffix of the array by 11.  Decrease all elements of a suffix of the array by 11. A suffix is a subsegment (contiguous elements) of the array that contains anan. In other words, for all ii where aiai is included in the subsegment, all ajaj's where i<j\u2264ni<j\u2264n must also be included in the subsegment.Gildong wants to make all elements of aa equal \u2014 he will always do so using the minimum number of operations necessary. To make his life even easier, before Gildong starts using the machine, you have the option of changing one of the integers in the array to any other integer. You are allowed to leave the array unchanged. You want to minimize the number of operations Gildong performs.

Now Gildong can use the 22-nd operation once on the suffix starting at a2a2, which means a2a2 and a3a3 are decreased by 11, making all elements of the array \u22121\u22121.In the third case, we can set a1a1 to 9696, so that the array becomes [96,96,97,95][96,96,97,95]. Now Gildong needs to:   Use the 22-nd operation on the suffix starting at a3a3 once, making the array [96,96,96,94][96,96,96,94].  Use the 11-st operation on the suffix starting at a4a4 22 times, making the array [96,96,96,96][96,96,96,96].

In other words, Polycarp does not like the string ss if there is an integer jj (1\u2264j\u2264n\u221221\u2264j\u2264n\u22122), that sjsj+1sj+2=sjsj+1sj+2=\"one\" or sjsj+1sj+2=sjsj+1sj+2=\"two\".For example:  Polycarp does not like strings \"oneee\", \"ontwow\", \"twone\" and \"oneonetwo\" (they all have at least one substring \"one\" or \"two\"),  Polycarp likes strings \"oonnee\", \"twwwo\" and \"twnoe\" (they have no substrings \"one\" and \"two\"). Polycarp wants to select a certain set of indices (positions) and remove all letters on these positions. All removals are made at the same time.For example, if the string looks like s=s=\"onetwone\", then if Polycarp selects two indices 33 and 66, then \"onetwone\" will be selected and the result is \"ontwne\".What is the minimum number of indices (positions) that Polycarp needs to select to make the string liked?

There are 106106 employees, numbered from 11 to 106106.The security system logs entrances and departures. The entrance of the ii-th employee is denoted by the integer ii, while the departure of the ii-th employee is denoted by the integer \u2212i\u2212i.The company has some strict rules about access to its office:  An employee can enter the office at most once per day.  He obviously can't leave the office if he didn't enter it earlier that day.  In the beginning and at the end of every day, the office is empty (employees can't stay at night). It may also be empty at any moment of the day. Any array of events satisfying these conditions is called a valid day.Some examples of valid or invalid days:  [1,7,\u22127,3,\u22121,\u22123][1,7,\u22127,3,\u22121,\u22123] is a valid day (11 enters, 77 enters, 77 leaves, 33 enters, 11 leaves, 33 leaves).  [2,\u22122,3,\u22123][2,\u22122,3,\u22123] is also a valid day.  [2,5,\u22125,5,\u22125,\u22122][2,5,\u22125,5,\u22125,\u22122] is not a valid day, because 55 entered the office twice during the same day.

There are nn events a1,a2,\u2026,ana1,a2,\u2026,an, in the order they occurred. This array corresponds to one or more consecutive days. The system administrator erased the dates of events by mistake, but he didn't change the order of the events.You must partition (to cut) the array aa of events into contiguous subarrays, which must represent non-empty valid days (or say that it's impossible). Each array element should belong to exactly one contiguous subarray of a partition. Each contiguous subarray of a partition should be a valid day.For example, if n=8n=8 and a=[1,\u22121,1,2,\u22121,\u22122,3,\u22123]a=[1,\u22121,1,2,\u22121,\u22122,3,\u22123] then he can partition it into two contiguous subarrays which are valid days: a=[1,\u22121\u00a0|\u00a01,2,\u22121,\u22122,3,\u22123]a=[1,\u22121\u00a0|\u00a01,2,\u22121,\u22122,3,\u22123].Help the administrator to partition the given array aa in the required way or report that it is impossible to do.

We can construct an array bb consisting of r+cr+c integers as follows: for each i\u2208[1,r]i\u2208[1,r], let bibi be the greatest common divisor of integers in the ii-th row, and for each j\u2208[1,c]j\u2208[1,c] let br+jbr+j be the greatest common divisor of integers in the jj-th column. We call the matrix diverse if all r+cr+c numbers bkbk (k\u2208[1,r+c]k\u2208[1,r+c]) are pairwise distinct. The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of bkbk.For example, suppose we have the following matrix: (249144784)(297414484) We construct the array bb:  b1b1 is the greatest common divisor of 22, 99, and 77, that is 11;  b2b2 is the greatest common divisor of 44, 144144, and 8484, that is 44;  b3b3 is the greatest common divisor of 22 and 44, that is 22;  b4b4 is the greatest common divisor of 99 and 144144, that is 99;  b5b5 is the greatest common divisor of 77 and 8484, that is 77. So b=[1,4,2,9,7]b=[1,4,2,9,7]. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to 99.For a given rr and cc, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer 00.

The ii-th of them should contain cc space-separated integers, the jj-th of which is ai,jai,j \u2014 the positive integer in the ii-th row and jj-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.Furthermore, it must hold that 1\u2264ai,j\u22641091\u2264ai,j\u2264109.

All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is 44. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least 11, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size 2\u00d722\u00d72 with magnitude smaller than 44.In the second example, no matter what a1,1a1,1 is, b1=b2b1=b2 will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices."], "Sereja and Bottles": ["https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/315/A", "A.

Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor\u2009+\u2009 lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor\u2009=\u200910\u2009+\u200910\u2009=\u2009 20.In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is .In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit.

In other words, every two of her friends a, b know each other, possibly indirectly (there is a sequence of friends starting from a and ending on b and such that each two consecutive friends in the sequence know each other directly), and there are exactly n\u2009-\u20091 pairs of friends who know each other directly.Jenny is given the number 0.InputThe first line of the input contains the number of friends n (3\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100).

You know your task is to make factory facilities, but before you even start, you need to know how big the factory is and how many rooms it has. When you look at the data you see that you have the dimensions of the construction, which is in rectangle shape: N x M. Then in the next N lines you have M numbers. These numbers represent factory tiles and they can go from 0 to 15. Each of these numbers should be looked in its binary form. Because from each number you know on which side the tile has walls. For example number 10 in it's binary form is 1010, which means that it has a wall from the North side, it doesn't have a wall from the East, it has a wall on the South side and it doesn't have a wall on the West side. So it goes North, East, South, West. It is guaranteed that the construction always has walls on it's edges. The input will be correct.

The company that created this robot asked you to optimize the path of the robot somehow. To do this, you can remove any non-empty substring of the path. But this company doesn't want their customers to notice the change in the robot behavior. It means that if before the optimization the robot ended its path at the point (xe,ye)(xe,ye), then after optimization (i.e. removing some single substring from ss) the robot also ends its path at the point (xe,ye)(xe,ye).This optimization is a low-budget project so you need to remove the shortest possible non-empty substring to optimize the robot's path such that the endpoint of his path doesn't change. It is possible that you can't optimize the path.

So he decided to walk through the gateways to have some fun. And luck smiled at him! When he entered the first courtyard, he met a strange man who was selling something. Denis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.When he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of nn steps. At the ii-th step, a place is chosen for the number ii (1\u2264i\u2264n)(1\u2264i\u2264n). The position for the number ii is defined as follows:  For all jj from 11 to nn, we calculate rjrj \u00a0\u2014 the minimum index such that j\u2264rj\u2264nj\u2264rj\u2264n, and the position rjrj is not yet occupied in the permutation. If there are no such positions, then we assume that the value of rjrj is not defined.  For all tt from 11 to nn, we calculate counttcountt \u00a0\u2014 the number of positions 1\u2264j\u2264n1\u2264j\u2264n such that rjrj is defined and rj=trj=t.  Consider the positions that are still not occupied by permutation and among those we consider the positions for which the value in the countcount array is maximum.  The generator selects one of these positions for the number ii. The generator can choose any position. Let's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:  Let n=5n=5 and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers 1,2,31,2,3 in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number 44:  The values of rr will be r=[3,3,3,4,\u00d7]r=[3,3,3,4,\u00d7], where \u00d7\u00d7 means an indefinite value.  Then the countcount values will be count=[0,0,3,1,0]count=[0,0,3,1,0].  There are only two unoccupied positions in the permutation: 33 and 44. The value in the countcount array for position 33 is 33, for position 44 it is 11.  The maximum value is reached only for position 33, so the algorithm will uniquely select this position for number 44. Satisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind p1,p2,\u2026,pnp1,p2,\u2026,pn and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.Unfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help.

For example, [1][1], [3,5,2,1,4][3,5,2,1,4], [1,3,2][1,3,2] are permutations, and [2,3,2][2,3,2], [4,3,1][4,3,1], [0][0] are not.Polycarp was presented with a permutation pp of numbers from 11 to nn.

Let's consider the road (for simplicity) as a segment [0,n][0,n] on OXOX axis. The road can have several crossroads, but for simplicity, we'll denote each crossroad as an interval (x,x+1)(x,x+1) with integer xx. So we can represent the road as a binary string consisting of nn characters, where character 0 means that current interval doesn't contain a crossroad, and 1 means that there is a crossroad.Usually, we can install the pipeline along the road on height of 11 unit with supporting pillars in each integer point (so, if we are responsible for [0,n][0,n] road, we must install n+1n+1 pillars). But on crossroads we should lift the pipeline up to the height 22, so the pipeline won't obstruct the way for cars.We can do so inserting several zig-zag-like lines. Each zig-zag can be represented as a segment [x,x+1][x,x+1] with integer xx consisting of three parts: 0.50.5 units of horizontal pipe + 11 unit of vertical pipe + 0.50.5 of horizontal. Note that if pipeline is currently on height 22, the pillars that support it should also have length equal to 22 units.  Each unit of gas pipeline costs us aa bourles, and each unit of pillar \u2014 bb bourles. So, it's not always optimal to make the whole pipeline on the height 22.

Furthermore, you may send exactly one command to all of the robots.

The upper left cell will be referred to as (1,1)(1,1) and the lower right cell as (n,m)(n,m).Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size dd (d>0d>0) with its center in cell (i,j)(i,j) is drawn as follows:   First, the center cell (i,j)(i,j) is painted black.  Then exactly dd cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly dd cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black.  That is all the cells with coordinates (i\u2212h,j\u00b1h)(i\u2212h,j\u00b1h) for all hh between 00 and dd are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d+12d+1 black cells. An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4\u00d794\u00d79 box, with two ticks of sizes 22 and 33.  You are given a description of a checkered field of size n\u00d7mn\u00d7m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 00) ticks on it.

He considered each non-empty subsequence of the sequence aa, computed the bitwise XOR of its elements and added up all the XORs, obtaining the coziness of the sequence aa.A sequence cc is a subsequence of a sequence dd if cc can be obtained from dd by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4], [2,4][2,4], and [2][2] are subsequences of [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4], but [4,3][4,3] and [0][0] are not.Divan was very proud of his analysis, but now he lost the sequence aa, and also the coziness value!

However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that 11 ton of fuel can lift off aiai tons of rocket from the ii-th planet or to land bibi tons of rocket onto the ii-th planet. For example, if the weight of rocket is 99 tons, weight of fuel is 33 tons and take-off coefficient is 88 (ai=8ai=8), then 1.51.5 tons of fuel will be burnt (since 1.5\u22c58=9+31.5\u22c58=9+3). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be 1.51.5 tons. Please note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.Help Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Actually, this problem is a subtask of the problem D2 from the same contest and the solution of D2 solves this subtask too.A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers f(a1a2\u2026ap\u22121ap,b1b2\u2026bq\u22121bq)f(a1a2\u2026ap\u22121ap,b1b2\u2026bq\u22121bq), where a1\u2026apa1\u2026ap and b1\u2026bqb1\u2026bq are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.In other words, the function f(x,y)f(x,y) alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers xx and yy by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number yy.

Weights Assignment For Tree Edgestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a rooted tree consisting of nn vertices. Vertices are numbered from 11 to nn. Any vertex can be the root of a tree.A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root.The tree is specified by an array of ancestors bb containing nn numbers: bibi is an ancestor of the vertex with the number ii. The ancestor of a vertex uu is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from uu to the root. For example, on the simple path from 55 to 33 (the root), the next vertex would be 11, so the ancestor of 55 is 11.The root has no ancestor, so for it, the value of bibi is ii (the root is the only vertex for which bi=ibi=i).For example, if n=5n=5 and b=[3,1,3,3,1]b=[3,1,3,3,1], then the tree looks like this.  An example of a rooted tree for n=5n=5, the root of the tree is a vertex number 33. You are given an array pp\u00a0\u2014 a permutation of the vertices of the tree. If it is possible, assign any positive integer weights on the edges, so that the vertices sorted by distance from the root would form the given permutation pp.In other words, for a given permutation of vertices pp, it is necessary to choose such edge weights so that the condition dist[pi]<dist[pi+1]dist[pi]<dist[pi+1] is true for each ii from 11 to n\u22121n\u22121. dist[u]dist[u] is a sum of the weights of the edges on the path from the root to uu. In particular, dist[u]=0dist[u]=0 if the vertex uu is the root of the tree.For example, assume that p=[3,1,2,5,4]p=[3,1,2,5,4]. In this case, the following edge weights satisfy this permutation:  the edge (3,43,4) has a weight of 102102;  the edge (3,13,1) has weight of 11;  the edge (1,21,2) has a weight of 1010;  the edge (1,51,5) has a weight of 100100. The array of distances from the root looks like: dist=[1,11,0,102,101]dist=[1,11,0,102,101]. The vertices sorted by increasing the distance from the root form the given permutation pp.Print the required edge weights or determine that there is no suitable way to assign weights. If there are several solutions, then print any of them.InputThe first line of input data contains an integer tt (1\u2264t\u22641041\u2264t\u2264104) \u2014 the number of input data sets in the test.Each test case consists of three lines.The first of them contains an integer nn (1\u2264n\u22642\u22c51051\u2264n\u22642\u22c5105).

For the root there is no such edge, so use the value wi=0wi=0. For all other vertices, the values of wiwi must satisfy the inequality 1\u2264wi\u22641091\u2264wi\u2264109. There can be equal numbers among wiwi values, but all sums of weights of edges from the root to vertices must be different and satisfy the given permutation.If there are several solutions, output any of them.If no solution exists, output -1.ExampleInputCopy4\n5\n3 1 3 3 1\n3 1 2 5 4\n3\n1 1 2\n3 1 2\n7\n1 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n6\n4 4 4 4 1 1\n4 2 1 5 6 3\nOutputCopy1 10 0 102 100\n-1\n0 3 100 1 1 2 4\n6 5 10 0 2 3NoteThe first set of input data of the example is analyzed in the main part of the statement.In the second set of input data of the example, it is impossible to assign the positive weights to obtain a given permutation of vertices."], "Marvolo Gaunt's Ring": ["https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/855/B", "B.
