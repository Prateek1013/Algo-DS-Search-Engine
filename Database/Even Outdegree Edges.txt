CSES - Even Outdegree Edges


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that in the resulting directed graph each node has an even outdegree. The outdegree of a node is the number of edges coming out of that node.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

After this, there are mm lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

You may assume that the graph is simple, i.e., there is at most one edge between any two nodes and every edge connects two distinct nodes.

Output

Print mm lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is an edge from node aa to node bb. You can print any valid solution.

If there are no solutions, only print "IMPOSSIBLE".
