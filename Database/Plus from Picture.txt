B. Plus from Picturetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a given picture with size w×hw×h. Determine if the given picture has a single "+" shape or not. A "+" shape is described below:  A "+" shape has one center nonempty cell.  There should be some (at least one) consecutive non-empty cells in each direction (left, right, up, down) from the center. In other words, there should be a ray in each direction.  All other cells are empty. Find out if the given picture has single "+" shape.InputThe first line contains two integers hh and ww (1≤h1≤h, w≤500w≤500) — the height and width of the picture.The ii-th of the next hh lines contains string sisi of length ww consisting "." and "*" where "." denotes the empty space and "*" denotes the non-empty space.OutputIf the given picture satisfies all conditions, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExamplesInputCopy5 6
