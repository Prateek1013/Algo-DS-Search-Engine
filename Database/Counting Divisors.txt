Given nn integers, your task is to report for each integer the number of its divisors.

For example, if x=18x=18, the correct answer is 66 because its divisors are 1,2,3,6,9,181,2,3,6,9,18.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of integers.

After this, there are nn lines, each containing an integer xx.
