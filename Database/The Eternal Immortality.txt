Here a! denotes the factorial of integer a, that is, a! = 1 × 2 × ... × a. Specifically, 0! = 1.Koyomi doesn't care much about this, but before he gets into another mess with oddities, he is interested in the number of times the phoenix will reincarnate in a timespan of b! years, that is, . Note that when b ≥ a this value is always integer.As the answer can be quite large, it would be enough for Koyomi just to know the last digit of the answer in decimal representation. And you're here to provide Koyomi with this knowledge.InputThe first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1018).OutputOutput one line containing a single decimal digit — the last digit of the value that interests Koyomi.ExamplesInputCopy2 4OutputCopy2InputCopy0 10OutputCopy0InputCopy107 109OutputCopy2NoteIn the first example, the last digit of  is 2;In the second example, the last digit of  is 0;In the third example, the last digit of  is 2.
