Chef is very adventurous, so he asked Bob to give him a task.
Bob gave him a sequence of blocks with heights A1,A2,…,AN. Chef is at the first block and he has to reach the N-th block using the minimum number of moves to complete the task.
In one move, he can jump from the i-th block to the j-th block only if the following conditions are satisfied:

i<j
Ai≥Aj
for all k (i<k<j), Ak≤Aj

You have to find the minimum number of moves Chef needs to perform to reach the last block, or determine that it is impossible.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the minimum number of moves or −1 if it is impossible to reach the last block.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤105 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points):

2≤N≤1,000
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅104

Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: There is no way to move from the first block (with height 9) to any other block.
Example case 2: The only sequence of 4 moves is 20→17→15→8→7. For example, in the first move, all the heights between 20 and 17 do not exceed 17, so all conditions are satisfied.
