Given an array of nn integers, your task is to process qq queries of the following types:
 increase each value in range [a,b][a,b] by uu
 what is the value at position kk?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the number of values and queries.

The second line has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the array values.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. Each line has three integers: either "11 aa bb uu" or "22 kk".

Output

Print the result of each query of type 2.
