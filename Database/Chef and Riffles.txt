Let ff be a permutation of length NN, where NN is even. The riffle of ff is defined to be the permutation
g=(f(1),f(3),…,f(N−1),f(2),f(4),…,f(N))g=(f(1),f(3),…,f(N−1),f(2),f(4),…,f(N))
You are given two integers NN and KK. Output the resultant permutation when you riffle the identity permutation of length NN, KK times.
The identity permutation of length NN is σN=(1,2,…,N)σN=(1,2,…,N)
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers NN and K.

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer permutation as N space-separated integers in a new line.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤3⋅105
1≤K≤109
N is even
The sum of N across test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (30 points): N is a power of 2

Explanation
Test case 1: Performing the riffle on σ6=(1,2,3,4,5,6) once results in (1,3,5,2,4,6), by definition.
Test case 2: The process goes as follows:

Performing the riffle on (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) results in (1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8)
Performing the riffle on (1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8) results in (1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8)
