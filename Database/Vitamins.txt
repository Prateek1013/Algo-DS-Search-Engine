Each juice includes some set of vitamins in it. There are three types of vitamins: vitamin "A", vitamin "B" and vitamin "C". Each juice can contain one, two or all three types of vitamins in it.Petya knows that he needs all three types of vitamins to stay healthy. What is the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins? Petya obtains some vitamin if he buys at least one juice containing it and drinks it.InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1000)(1≤n≤1000) — the number of juices.Each of the next nn lines contains an integer cici (1≤ci≤100000)(1≤ci≤100000) and a string sisi — the price of the ii-th juice and the vitamins it contains. String sisi contains from 11 to 33 characters, and the only possible characters are "A", "B" and "C". It is guaranteed that each letter appears no more than once in each string sisi. The order of letters in strings sisi is arbitrary.OutputPrint -1 if there is no way to obtain all three vitamins.

He spends 5+6+4=155+6+4=15 and obtains all three vitamins. He can also buy just the third juice and obtain three vitamins, but its cost is 1616, which isn't optimal.In the second example Petya can't obtain all three vitamins, as no juice contains vitamin "C".
