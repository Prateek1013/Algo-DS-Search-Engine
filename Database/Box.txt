For example, the following sequences are permutations: [3,4,1,2][3,4,1,2], [1][1], [1,2][1,2]. The following sequences are not permutations: [0][0], [1,2,1][1,2,1], [2,3][2,3], [0,1,2][0,1,2].The important key is in the locked box that you need to open. To open the box you need to enter secret code. Secret code is a permutation pp of length nn. You don't know this permutation, you only know the array qq of prefix maximums of this permutation. Formally:  q1=p1q1=p1,  q2=max(p1,p2)q2=max(p1,p2),  q3=max(p1,p2,p3)q3=max(p1,p2,p3),  ...  qn=max(p1,p2,…,pn)qn=max(p1,p2,…,pn). You want to construct any possible suitable permutation (i.e. any such permutation, that calculated qq for this permutation is equal to the given array).InputThe first line contains integer number tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.The first line of a test case contains one integer nn (1≤n≤105)(1≤n≤105) — the number of elements in the secret code permutation pp.The second line of a test case contains nn integers q1,q2,…,qnq1,q2,…,qn (1≤qi≤n)(1≤qi≤n) — elements of the array qq for secret permutation. It is guaranteed that qi≤qi+1qi≤qi+1 for all ii (1≤i<n1≤i<n).The sum of all values nn over all the test cases in the input doesn't exceed 105105.OutputFor each test case, print:  If it's impossible to find such a permutation pp, print "-1" (without quotes).  Otherwise, print nn distinct integers p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn (1≤pi≤n1≤pi≤n). If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. ExampleInputCopy4

NoteIn the first test case of the example answer [1,3,4,5,2][1,3,4,5,2] is the only possible answer:  q1=p1=1q1=p1=1;  q2=max(p1,p2)=3q2=max(p1,p2)=3;  q3=max(p1,p2,p3)=4q3=max(p1,p2,p3)=4;  q4=max(p1,p2,p3,p4)=5q4=max(p1,p2,p3,p4)=5;  q5=max(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5)=5q5=max(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5)=5. It can be proved that there are no answers for the second test case of the example.
