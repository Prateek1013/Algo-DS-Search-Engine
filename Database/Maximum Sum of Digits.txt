B. Maximum Sum of Digitstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer nn.Let S(x)S(x) be sum of digits in base 10 representation of xx, for example, S(123)=1+2+3=6S(123)=1+2+3=6, S(0)=0S(0)=0.Your task is to find two integers a,ba,b, such that 0≤a,b≤n0≤a,b≤n, a+b=na+b=n and S(a)+S(b)S(a)+S(b) is the largest possible among all such pairs.InputThe only line of input contains an integer nn (1≤n≤1012)(1≤n≤1012).OutputPrint largest S(a)+S(b)S(a)+S(b) among all pairs of integers a,ba,b, such that 0≤a,b≤n0≤a,b≤n and a+b=na+b=n.ExamplesInputCopy35OutputCopy17InputCopy10000000000OutputCopy91NoteIn the first example, you can choose, for example, a=17a=17 and b=18b=18, so that S(17)+S(18)=1+7+1+8=17S(17)+S(18)=1+7+1+8=17. It can be shown that it is impossible to get a larger answer.In the second test example, you can choose, for example, a=5000000001a=5000000001 and b=4999999999b=4999999999, with S(5000000001)+S(4999999999)=91S(5000000001)+S(4999999999)=91. It can be shown that it is impossible to get a larger answer.
