The first and only line of each test case contains string ss (2≤|s|≤2⋅1052≤|s|≤2⋅105). Each character sisi is digit 0–9.It's guaranteed that the total length of strings doesn't exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of characters you need to erase from ss to make it good.ExampleInputCopy3

NoteIn the first test case, you can erase any 33 characters, for example, the 11-st, the 33-rd, and the 44-th. You'll get string 51 and it is good.In the second test case, we can erase all characters except 0: the remaining string is 0000 and it's good.In the third test case, the given string ss is already good.
