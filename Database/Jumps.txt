Suppose you're currently at point yy (yy may be negative) and jump for the kk-th time. You can:   either jump to the point y+ky+k  or jump to the point y−1y−1. What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point xx?InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer xx (1≤x≤1061≤x≤106) — the destination point.OutputFor each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach xx. It can be proved that we can reach any integer point xx.ExampleInputCopy5

NoteIn the first test case x=1x=1, so you need only one jump: the 11-st jump from 00 to 0+1=10+1=1.In the second test case x=2x=2. You need at least three jumps:   the 11-st jump from 00 to 0+1=10+1=1;  the 22-nd jump from 11 to 1+2=31+2=3;  the 33-rd jump from 33 to 3−1=23−1=2; Two jumps are not enough because these are the only possible variants:   the 11-st jump as −1−1 and the 22-nd one as −1−1 — you'll reach 0−1−1=−20−1−1=−2;  the 11-st jump as −1−1 and the 22-nd one as +2+2 — you'll reach 0−1+2=10−1+2=1;  the 11-st jump as +1+1 and the 22-nd one as −1−1 — you'll reach 0+1−1=00+1−1=0;  the 11-st jump as +1+1 and the 22-nd one as +2+2 — you'll reach 0+1+2=30+1+2=3; In the third test case, you need two jumps: the 11-st one as +1+1 and the 22-nd one as +2+2, so 0+1+2=30+1+2=3.In the fourth test case, you need three jumps: the 11-st one as −1−1, the 22-nd one as +2+2 and the 33-rd one as +3+3, so 0−1+2+3=40−1+2+3=4.
