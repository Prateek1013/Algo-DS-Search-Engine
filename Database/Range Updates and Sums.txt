Your task is to maintain an array of nn values and efficiently process the following types of queries:
 Increase each value in range [a,b][a,b] by xx.
 Set each value in range [a,b][a,b] to xx.
 Calculate the sum of values in range [a,b][a,b].

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the array size and the number of queries.

The next line has nn values t1,t2,…,tnt1,t2,…,tn: the initial contents of the array.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1 aa bb xx",  "2 aa bb xx", or "3 aa bb". 

Output

Print the answer to each sum query.
