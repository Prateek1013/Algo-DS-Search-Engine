Do you know Professor Saeed? He is the algorithms professor at Damascus University. Yesterday, he gave his students hard homework (he is known for being so evil) - for a given binary string SS, they should compute the sum of F(S,L,R)F(S,L,R) over all pairs of integers (L,R)(L,R) (1≤L≤R≤|S|), where the function F(S,L,R) is defined as follows:

Create a string U: first, set U=S, and for each i (L≤i≤R), flip the i-th character of U (change '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').
Then, F(S,L,R) is the number of valid pairs (i,i+1) such that Ui=Ui+1.

As usual, Professor Saeed will give more points to efficient solutions. Please help the students solve this homework.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ∑1≤L≤R≤|S|F(S,L,R).
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤|S|≤3⋅106
the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 6⋅106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points):

1≤|S|≤300
the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 600

Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1:

L=1,R=1: U is "101", F=0
L=2,R=2: U is "011", F=1
L=3,R=3: U is "000", F=2
L=1,R=2: U is "111", F=2
L=2,R=3: U is "010", F=0
L=1,R=3: U is "110", F=1
