It consists of nn stacks of blocks, where the ii-th stack consists of aiai blocks resting on the surface.The height of the exhibit is equal to mm. Consequently, the number of blocks in each stack is less than or equal to mm.There is a camera on the ceiling that sees the top view of the blocks and a camera on the right wall that sees the side view of the blocks. Find the maximum number of blocks you can remove such that the views for both the cameras would not change.Note, that while originally all blocks are stacked on the floor, it is not required for them to stay connected to the floor after some blocks are removed. There is no gravity in the whole exhibition, so no block would fall down, even if the block underneath is removed. It is not allowed to move blocks by hand either.InputThe first line contains two integers nn and mm (1≤n≤1000001≤n≤100000, 1≤m≤1091≤m≤109) — the number of stacks and the height of the exhibit.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤m1≤ai≤m) — the number of blocks in each stack from left to right.OutputPrint exactly one integer — the maximum number of blocks that can be removed.ExamplesInputCopy5 63 3 3 3 3OutputCopy10InputCopy3 51 2 4OutputCopy3InputCopy5 52 3 1 4 4OutputCopy9InputCopy1 1000548OutputCopy0InputCopy3 33 1 1OutputCopy1NoteThe following pictures illustrate the first example and its possible solution.Blue cells indicate removed blocks. There are 1010 blue cells, so the answer is 1010.
