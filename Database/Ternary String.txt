B. Ternary Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string ss such that each its character is either 1, 2, or 3. You have to choose the shortest contiguous substring of ss such that it contains each of these three characters at least once.A contiguous substring of string ss is a string that can be obtained from ss by removing some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of ss and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of ss.InputThe first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤200001≤t≤20000) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing the string ss (1≤|s|≤2000001≤|s|≤200000). It is guaranteed that each character of ss is either 1, 2, or 3.The sum of lengths of all strings in all test cases does not exceed 200000200000.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the length of the shortest contiguous substring of ss containing all three types of characters at least once. If there is no such substring, print 00 instead.ExampleInputCopy7

NoteConsider the example test:In the first test case, the substring 123 can be used.In the second test case, the substring 213 can be used.In the third test case, the substring 1223 can be used.In the fourth test case, the substring 3221 can be used.In the fifth test case, there is no character 3 in ss.In the sixth test case, there is no character 1 in ss.In the seventh test case, the substring 3112 can be used.
