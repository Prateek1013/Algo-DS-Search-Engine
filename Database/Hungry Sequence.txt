B. Hungry Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIahub and Iahubina went to a date at a luxury restaurant. Everything went fine until paying for the food. Instead of money, the waiter wants Iahub to write a Hungry sequence consisting of n integers. A sequence a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers, is Hungry if and only if:   Its elements are in increasing order. That is an inequality ai < aj holds for any two indices i, j (i < j).  For any two indices i and j (i < j), aj must not be divisible by ai. Iahub is in trouble, so he asks you for help. Find a Hungry sequence with n elements.InputThe input contains a single integer: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).OutputOutput a line that contains n space-separated integers a1 a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 107), representing a possible Hungry sequence. Note, that each ai must not be greater than 10000000 (107) and less than 1.If there are multiple solutions you can output any one.ExamplesInputCopy3OutputCopy2 9 15InputCopy5OutputCopy11 14 20 27 31
