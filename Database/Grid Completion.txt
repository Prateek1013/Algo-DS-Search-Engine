Your task is to create an n×nn×n grid whose each row and column has exactly one A and B. Some of the characters have already been placed. In how many ways can you complete the grid?

Input

After this, there are nn lines that describe the grid. Each line has nn characters: . means an empty square, and A and B show the characters already placed.

You can assume that every row and column has at most one A and B.
