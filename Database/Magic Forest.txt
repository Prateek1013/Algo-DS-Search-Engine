B. Magic Foresttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImp is in a magic forest, where xorangles grow (wut?)  A xorangle of order n is such a non-degenerate triangle, that lengths of its sides are integers not exceeding n, and the xor-sum of the lengths is equal to zero. Imp has to count the number of distinct xorangles of order n to get out of the forest. Formally, for a given integer n you have to find the number of such triples (a, b, c), that:  1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ n;  , where  denotes the bitwise xor of integers x and y.  (a, b, c) form a non-degenerate (with strictly positive area) triangle. InputThe only line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2500).OutputPrint the number of xorangles of order n.ExamplesInputCopy6OutputCopy1InputCopy10OutputCopy2NoteThe only xorangle in the first sample is (3, 5, 6).
