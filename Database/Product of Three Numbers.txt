C. Product of Three Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given one integer number nn. Find three distinct integers a,b,ca,b,c such that 2≤a,b,c2≤a,b,c and a⋅b⋅c=na⋅b⋅c=n or say that it is impossible to do it.If there are several answers, you can print any.You have to answer tt independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.The next nn lines describe test cases. The ii-th test case is given on a new line as one integer nn (2≤n≤1092≤n≤109).OutputFor each test case, print the answer on it. Print "NO" if it is impossible to represent nn as a⋅b⋅ca⋅b⋅c for some distinct integers a,b,ca,b,c such that 2≤a,b,c2≤a,b,c.Otherwise, print "YES" and any possible such representation.ExampleInputCopy5
