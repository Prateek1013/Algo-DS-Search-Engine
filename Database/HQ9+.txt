The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.InputThe input will consist of a single line p which will give a program in HQ9+. String p will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of p will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.OutputOutput "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).ExamplesInputCopyHello!OutputCopyYESInputCopyProgopediaOutputCopyNONoteIn the first case the program contains only one instruction â€” "H", which prints "Hello, World!".In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.
