B. Shuffletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array consisting of nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan. Initially ax=1ax=1, all other elements are equal to 00.You have to perform mm operations. During the ii-th operation, you choose two indices cc and dd such that li≤c,d≤rili≤c,d≤ri, and swap acac and adad.Calculate the number of indices kk such that it is possible to choose the operations so that ak=1ak=1 in the end.InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then the description of tt testcases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers nn, xx and mm (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109; 1≤m≤1001≤m≤100; 1≤x≤n1≤x≤n).Each of next mm lines contains the descriptions of the operations; the ii-th line contains two integers lili and riri (1≤li≤ri≤n1≤li≤ri≤n).OutputFor each test case print one integer — the number of indices kk such that it is possible to choose the operations so that ak=1ak=1 in the end.ExampleInputCopy3

NoteIn the first test case, it is possible to achieve ak=1ak=1 for every kk. To do so, you may use the following operations:  swap akak and a4a4;  swap a2a2 and a2a2;  swap a5a5 and a5a5. In the second test case, only k=1k=1 and k=2k=2 are possible answers. To achieve a1=1a1=1, you have to swap a1a1 and a1a1 during the second operation. To achieve a2=1a2=1, you have to swap a1a1 and a2a2 during the second operation.
