B. Binary String Constructingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers aa, bb and xx. Your task is to construct a binary string ss of length n=a+bn=a+b such that there are exactly aa zeroes, exactly bb ones and exactly xx indices ii (where 1≤i<n1≤i<n) such that si≠si+1si≠si+1. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices ii such that 1≤i<n1≤i<n and si≠si+1si≠si+1 (i=1,2,3,4i=1,2,3,4). For the string "111001" there are two such indices ii (i=3,5i=3,5).Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.InputThe first line of the input contains three integers aa, bb and xx (1≤a,b≤100,1≤x<a+b)1≤a,b≤100,1≤x<a+b).OutputPrint only one string ss, where ss is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.ExamplesInputCopy2 2 1OutputCopy1100InputCopy3 3 3OutputCopy101100InputCopy5 3 6OutputCopy01010100NoteAll possible answers for the first example:   1100;  0011.
