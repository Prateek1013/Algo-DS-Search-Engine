B. Nice Matrixtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA matrix of size n×mn×m is called nice, if all rows and columns of the matrix are palindromes. A sequence of integers (a1,a2,…,ak)(a1,a2,…,ak) is a palindrome, if for any integer ii (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k) the equality ai=ak−i+1ai=ak−i+1 holds.Sasha owns a matrix aa of size n×mn×m. In one operation he can increase or decrease any number in the matrix by one. Sasha wants to make the matrix nice. He is interested what is the minimum number of operations he needs.Help him!InputThe first line contains a single integer tt — the number of test cases (1≤t≤101≤t≤10). The tt tests follow.The first line of each test contains two integers nn and mm (1≤n,m≤1001≤n,m≤100) — the size of the matrix.Each of the next nn lines contains mm integers ai,jai,j (0≤ai,j≤1090≤ai,j≤109) — the elements of the matrix.OutputFor each test output the smallest number of operations required to make the matrix nice.ExampleInputCopy2
