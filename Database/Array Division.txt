CSES - Array Division


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given an array containing nn positive integers.

Your task is to divide the array into kk subarrays so that the maximum sum in a subarray is as small as possible.

Input

The first input line contains two integers nn and kk: the size of the array and the number of subarrays in the division.

The next line contains nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Output

Print one integer: the maximum sum in a subarray in the optimal division.

Constraints

1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105
1≤k≤n1≤k≤n
1≤xi≤1091≤xi≤109

Example

Input:
5 3
2 4 7 3 5

Output:
8

Explanation: An optimal division is [2,4],[7],[3,5][2,4],[7],[3,5] where the sums of the subarrays are 6,7,86,7,8. The largest sum is the last sum 88.
