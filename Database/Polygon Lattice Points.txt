CSES - Polygon Lattice Points


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Given a polygon, your task is to calculate the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers.

The polygon consists of nn vertices (x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn)(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn). The vertices (xi,yi)(xi,yi) and (xi+1,yi+1)(xi+1,yi+1) are adjacent for i=1,2,…,n−1i=1,2,…,n−1, and the vertices (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (xn,yn)(xn,yn) are also adjacent.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of vertices.

After this, there are nn lines that describe the vertices. The iith such line has two integers xixi and yiyi.

You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself.

Output

Print two integers: the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary.
