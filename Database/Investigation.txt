You are going to travel from Syrjälä to Lehmälä by plane. You would like to find answers to the following questions:

 what is the minimum price of such a route?
 how many minimum-price routes are there? (modulo 109+7)109+7)
 what is the minimum number of flights in a minimum-price route?
 what is the maximum number of flights in a minimum-price route?

Input

The first input line contains two integers nn and mm: the number of cities and the number of flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. City 1 is Syrjälä, and city nn is Lehmälä.

After this, there are mm lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers aa, bb, and cc: there is a flight from city aa to city bb with price cc. All flights are one-way flights.

You may assume that there is a route from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.

Output

Print four integers according to the problem statement.
