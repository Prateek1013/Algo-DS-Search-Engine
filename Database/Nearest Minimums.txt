Find the distance between two closest (nearest) minimums in it. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.InputThe first line contains positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — size of the given array. The second line contains n integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.OutputPrint the only number — distance between two nearest minimums in the array.ExamplesInputCopy23 3OutputCopy1InputCopy35 6 5OutputCopy2InputCopy92 1 3 5 4 1 2 3 1OutputCopy3
