You are given an integer kk, a strictly increasing array aa and qq queries. For each query, you are given two integers li≤rili≤ri. Your task is to find how many arrays bb exist, such that bb is kk-similar to array [ali,ali+1…,ari][ali,ali+1…,ari]. InputThe first line contains three integers nn, qq and kk (1≤n,q≤1051≤n,q≤105, n≤k≤109n≤k≤109) — the length of array aa, the number of queries and number kk.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤k1≤ai≤k). This array is strictly increasing  — a1<a2<…<ana1<a2<…<an.Each of the following qq lines contains two integers lili, riri (1≤li≤ri≤n1≤li≤ri≤n).OutputPrint qq lines. The ii-th of them should contain the answer to the ii-th query.ExamplesInputCopy4 2 5

NoteIn the first example:In the first query there are 44 arrays that are 55-similar to [2,4][2,4]: [1,4],[3,4],[2,3],[2,5][1,4],[3,4],[2,3],[2,5].In the second query there are 33 arrays that are 55-similar to [4,5][4,5]: [1,5],[2,5],[3,5][1,5],[2,5],[3,5].
