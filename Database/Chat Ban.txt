C. Chat Bantime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are a usual chat user on the most famous streaming platform. Of course, there are some moments when you just want to chill and spam something.More precisely, you want to spam the emote triangle of size kk. It consists of 2k−12k−1 messages. The first message consists of one emote, the second one — of two emotes, ..., the kk-th one — of kk emotes, the k+1k+1-th one — of k−1k−1 emotes, ..., and the last one — of one emote.For example, the emote triangle for k=3k=3 consists of 55 messages:  Of course, most of the channels have auto moderation. Auto moderator of the current chat will ban you right after you spam at least xx emotes in succession (you can assume you are the only user in the chat). Now you are interested — how many messages will you write before getting banned? Or maybe you will not get banned at all (i.e. will write all 2k−12k−1 messages and complete your emote triangle successfully)? Note that if you get banned as a result of writing a message, this message is also counted.You have to answer tt independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The next tt lines describe test cases.The only line of the test case contains integers kk and xx (1≤k≤109;1≤x≤10181≤k≤109;1≤x≤1018).OutputFor each test case, print the number of messages you will write before getting banned for the corresponding values kk and xx.ExampleInputCopy7

NoteLet's analyze the test cases of the example.  In the first test case, you write three messages containing 11, 22 and 33 emotes respectively, and since 1+2+3≥61+2+3≥6, you get banned after that.  In the second test case, you write four messages containing 11, 22, 33 and 44 emotes respectively, and since 1+2+3+4≥71+2+3+4≥7, you get banned after that.  In the third test case, you write one message containing exactly 11 emote. It doesn't get you banned, since 1<21<2, but you have already finished posting your emote triangle. So you wrote one message successfully.  In the fourth test case, you write four messages containing 11, 22, 33 and 22 emotes respectively, and since 1+2+3+2≥71+2+3+2≥7, you get banned after that.  In the fifth test case, you write three messages containing 11, 22 and 11 emote respectively. It doesn't get you banned, since 1+2+1<51+2+1<5, but you have already finished posting your emote triangle. So you wrote three messages successfully.  In the sixth test case, since x=1x=1, you get banned as soon as you send your first message.  The seventh test case is too large to analyze, so we'll skip it.
