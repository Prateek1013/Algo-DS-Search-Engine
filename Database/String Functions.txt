CSES - String Functions

We consider a string of nn characters, indexed 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. Your task is to calculate all values of the following functions:

 z(i)z(i) denotes the maximum length of a substring that begins at position ii and is a prefix of the string. In addition, z(1)=0z(1)=0.
 π(i)π(i) denotes the maximum length of a substring that ends at position ii, is a prefix of the string, and whose length is at most i−1i−1.

Note that the function zz is used in the Z-algorithm, and the function ππ is used in the KMP algorithm.

Input

The only input line has a string of length nn. Each character is between a–z.

Output

Print two lines: first the values of the zz function, and then the values of the ππ function.
