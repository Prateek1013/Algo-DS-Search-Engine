F1. Tree of Life (easy)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHeidi has finally found the mythical Tree of Life – a legendary combinatorial structure which is said to contain a prophecy crucially needed to defeat the undead armies.On the surface, the Tree of Life is just a regular undirected tree well-known from computer science. This means that it is a collection of n points (called vertices), some of which are connected using n - 1 line segments (edges) so that each pair of vertices is connected by a path (a sequence of one or more edges).To decipher the prophecy, Heidi needs to perform a number of steps. The first is counting the number of lifelines in the tree – these are paths of length 2, i.e., consisting of two edges. Help her!InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n – the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 to n. Then n - 1 lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbers a b – the labels of the vertices connected by the edge (1 ≤ a < b ≤ n). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.OutputPrint one integer – the number of lifelines in the tree.ExamplesInputCopy41 21 31 4OutputCopy3InputCopy51 22 33 43 5OutputCopy4NoteIn the second sample, there are four lifelines: paths between vertices 1 and 3, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, and 4 and 5.
