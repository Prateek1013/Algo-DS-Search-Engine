Micro-Worldtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a Petri dish with bacteria and you are preparing to dive into the harsh micro-world. But, unfortunately, you don't have any microscope nearby, so you can't watch them.You know that you have nn bacteria in the Petri dish and size of the ii-th bacteria is aiai. Also you know intergalactic positive integer constant KK.The ii-th bacteria can swallow the jj-th bacteria if and only if ai>ajai>aj and ai≤aj+Kai≤aj+K. The jj-th bacteria disappear, but the ii-th bacteria doesn't change its size. The bacteria can perform multiple swallows. On each swallow operation any bacteria ii can swallow any bacteria jj if ai>ajai>aj and ai≤aj+Kai≤aj+K. The swallow operations go one after another.For example, the sequence of bacteria sizes a=[101,53,42,102,101,55,54]a=[101,53,42,102,101,55,54] and K=1K=1. The one of possible sequences of swallows is: [101,53,42,102,101––––,55,54][101,53,42,102,101_,55,54] →→ [101,53–––,42,102,55,54][101,53_,42,102,55,54] →→ [101––––,42,102,55,54][101_,42,102,55,54] →→ [42,102,55,54–––][42,102,55,54_] →→ [42,102,55][42,102,55]. In total there are 33 bacteria remained in the Petri dish.Since you don't have a microscope, you can only guess, what the minimal possible number of bacteria can remain in your Petri dish when you finally will find any microscope.InputThe first line contains two space separated positive integers nn and KK (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤K≤1061≤K≤106) — number of bacteria and intergalactic constant KK.The second line contains nn space separated integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1061≤ai≤106) — sizes of bacteria you have.OutputPrint the only integer — minimal possible number of bacteria can remain.ExamplesInputCopy7 1101 53 42 102 101 55 54OutputCopy3InputCopy6 520 15 10 15 20 25OutputCopy1InputCopy7 10000001 1 1 1 1 1 1OutputCopy7NoteThe first example is clarified in the problem statement.In the second example an optimal possible sequence of swallows is: [20,15,10,15,20–––,25][20,15,10,15,20_,25] →→ [20,15,10,15–––,25][20,15,10,15_,25] →→ [20,15,10–––,25][20,15,10_,25] →→ [20,15–––,25][20,15_,25] →→ [20–––,25][20_,25] →→ [25][25].In the third example no bacteria can swallow any other bacteria.
