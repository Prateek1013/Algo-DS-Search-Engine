Your task is to find a minimum length bit string that has exactly nn distinct subsequences.

For example, a correct solution for n=6n=6 is 101 whose distinct subsequences are 0, 1, 01, 10, 11 and 101.

Input

The only input line has an integer nn.

Output

Print one bit string: a solution to the task. You can print any valid solution.

Constraints

 1≤n≤1061≤n≤106

Example

Input:
6

Output:
