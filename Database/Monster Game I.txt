CSES - Monster Game I


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are playing a game that consists of nn levels. Each level has a monster. On levels 1,2,…,n−11,2,…,n−1, you can either kill or escape the monster. However, on level nn you must kill the final monster to win the game.

Killing a monster takes sfsf time where ss is the monster's strength and ff is your skill factor (lower skill factor is better). After killing a monster, you get a new skill factor. What is the minimum total time in which you can win the game?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and xx: the number of levels and your initial skill factor.

The second line has nn integers s1,s2,…,sns1,s2,…,sn: each monster's strength.

The third line has nn integers f1,f2,…,fnf1,f2,…,fn: your new skill factor after killing a monster.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum total time to win the game.
