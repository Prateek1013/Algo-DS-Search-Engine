Given two rooted trees, your task is to find out if they are isomorphic, i.e., it is possible to draw them so that they look the same.

Input

The first input line has an integer tt: the number of tests. Then, there are tt tests described as follows:

The first line has an integer nn: the number of nodes in both trees. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, and node 11 is the root.

Then, there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges of the first tree, and finally n−1n−1 lines describing the edges of the second tree.

Output

For each test, print "YES", if the trees are isomorphic, and "NO" otherwise.

Constraints

1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000
2≤n≤1052≤n≤105
the sum of all values of nn is at most 105105
