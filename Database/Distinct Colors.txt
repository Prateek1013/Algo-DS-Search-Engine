Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a rooted tree consisting of nn nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, and node 11 is the root. Each node has a color.

Your task is to determine for each node the number of distinct colors in the subtree of the node.

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The next line consists of nn integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn: the color of each node.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print nn integers: for each node 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, the number of distinct colors.
