A game has nn rooms and mm tunnels between them. Each room has a certain number of coins. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect while moving through the tunnels when you can freely choose your starting and ending room?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of rooms and tunnels. The rooms are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then, there are nn integers k1,k2,…,knk1,k2,…,kn: the number of coins in each room.

Finally, there are mm lines describing the tunnels. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is a tunnel from room aa to room bb. Each tunnel is a one-way tunnel.

Output

Print one integer: the maximum number of coins you can collect.
