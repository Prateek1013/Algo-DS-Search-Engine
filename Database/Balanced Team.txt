C. Balanced Teamtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are a coach at your local university. There are nn students under your supervision, the programming skill of the ii-th student is aiai.You have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than 55.Your task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of students.The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109), where aiai is a programming skill of the ii-th student.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.ExamplesInputCopy6

NoteIn the first example you can create a team with skills [12,17,15][12,17,15].In the second example you can take all students in a team because their programming skills are equal.In the third example you can create a team consisting of a single student (and you cannot create a team consisting of at least two students).
