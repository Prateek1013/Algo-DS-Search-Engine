CSES - Counting Paths


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a tree consisting of nn nodes, and mm paths in the tree.

Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that node.

Input

The first input line contains integers nn and mm: the number of nodes and paths. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Finally, there are mm lines describing the paths. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is a path between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print nn integers: for each node 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, the number of paths containing that node.
