Today the problem is as follows. Given an integer nn, you can perform the following operations zero or more times:  mul xx: multiplies nn by xx (where xx is an arbitrary positive integer).  sqrt: replaces nn with n−−√n (to apply this operation, n−−√n must be an integer). You can perform these operations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of nn, that can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve that minimum value?Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this problem, maybe you can help them?InputThe only line of the input contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1061≤n≤106) — the initial number.OutputPrint two integers: the minimum integer nn that can be achieved using the described operations and the minimum number of operations required.ExamplesInputCopy20OutputCopy10 2InputCopy5184OutputCopy6 4NoteIn the first example, you can apply the operation mul 55 to get 100100 and then sqrt to get 1010.In the second example, you can first apply sqrt to get 7272, then mul 1818 to get 12961296 and finally two more sqrt and you get 66.Note, that even if the initial value of nn is less or equal 106106, it can still become greater than 106106 after applying one or more operations.
