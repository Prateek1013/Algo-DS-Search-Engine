Chef has cooked N meatballs, numbered 1 through N. No two meatballs contain the same amount of meat. You want to eat the meatiest meatball, i.e. the meatball with the maximum amount of meat, but you do not know which one it is and Chef does not want to just give it for you. Therefore, he decided to play a game with you.
You may ask Chef at most Q=4+N/2 questions. In each question, you must give Chef the numbers of five distinct meatballs and Chef tells you the numbers of the 3-rd and 4-th meatiest of these meatballs. Find the number of the meatiest meatball!
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing the character '?', a space and five space-separated integers i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4 and i_5: the numbers of five distinct meatballs (in any order). Then, you must read a line containing two space-separated integers: the numbers of the 3-rd and 4-th meatiest meatball.
To finish solving a test case, print a line containing the character '!', a space and an integer i_m: the number of the meatiest meatball (1 \le i_m \le N).

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
Constraints
