CSES - Polynomial Queries


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to maintain an array of nn values and efficiently process the following types of queries:
Increase the first value in range [a,b][a,b] by 11, the second value by 22, the third value by 33, and so on.
Calculate the sum of values in range [a,b][a,b].

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the size of the array and the number of queries.

The next line has nn values t1,t2,…,tnt1,t2,…,tn: the initial contents of the array.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "1 aa bb" or "2 aa bb".

Output

Print the answer to each sum query.
