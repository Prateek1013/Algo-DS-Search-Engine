Test case 22: The month consists of 66 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). Akash takes a leave only on Saturday. Thus, he takes a leave for 11 day.
Test case 33: The month consists of 88 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday). Akash takes a leave only on Saturday. Thus, he takes a leave for 11 day.
