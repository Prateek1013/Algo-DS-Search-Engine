Your task is to calculate the area of a given polygon.

The polygon consists of nn vertices (x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn)(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn). The vertices (xi,yi)(xi,yi) and (xi+1,yi+1)(xi+1,yi+1) are adjacent for i=1,2,…,n−1i=1,2,…,n−1, and the vertices (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (xn,yn)(xn,yn) are also adjacent.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of vertices.

After this, there are nn lines that describe the vertices. The iith such line has two integers xixi and yiyi.

You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself.

Output

Print one integer: 2a2a where the area of the polygon is aa (this ensures that the result is an integer).
