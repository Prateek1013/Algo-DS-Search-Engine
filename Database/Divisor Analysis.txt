Given an integer, your task is to find the number, sum and product of its divisors. As an example, let us consider the number 1212:
 the number of divisors is 66 (they are 11, 22, 33, 44, 66, 1212)
 the sum of divisors is 1+2+3+4+6+12=281+2+3+4+6+12=28
 the product of divisors is 1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅6⋅12=17281⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅6⋅12=1728

Since the input number may be large, it is given as a prime factorization.

Input

The first line has an integer nn: the number of parts in the prime factorization.

After this, there are nn lines that describe the factorization. Each line has two numbers xx and kk where xx is a prime and kk is its power.

Output

Print three integers modulo 109+7109+7: the number, sum and product of the divisors.

Constraints
