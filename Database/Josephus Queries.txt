Consider a game where there are nn children (numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n) in a circle. During the game, every second child is removed from the circle, until there are no children left.

Your task is to process qq queries of the form: "when there are nn children, who is the kkth child that will be removed?"

Input

The first input line has an integer qq: the number of queries.
