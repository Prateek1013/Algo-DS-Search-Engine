Your task is to count the number of ways to construct sum nn by throwing a dice one or more times. Each throw produces an outcome between 11 and  66.

For example, if n=3n=3, there are 44 ways:
 1+1+11+1+1
 1+21+2
 2+12+1
 33

Input

The only input line has an integer nn.

Output

Print the number of ways modulo 109+7109+7.

Constraints
