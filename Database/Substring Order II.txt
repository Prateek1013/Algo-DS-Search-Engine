You are given a string of length nn. If all of its substrings (not necessarily distinct) are ordered lexicographically, what is the kkth smallest of them?

Input

The first input line has a string of length nn that consists of characters a–z.

The second input line has an integer kk.

Output

Print the kkth smallest substring in lexicographical order.

Constraints

1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
1≤k≤n(n+1)21≤k≤n(n+1)2

Example

Input:
baabaa
10

Output:
ab

Explanation: The 10 smallest substrings in order are a, a, a, a, aa, aa, aab, aaba, aabaa, and ab.
