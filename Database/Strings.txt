Given a binary number SS containing only of 1's and 0's, find two binary numbers AA and BB such that the sum of the number of 1's in A and B is minimum and A−B=S. If there are many such numbers, you can print any.
The binary number S has some properties. See the Constraints section for details.
Input:

The only line of input contains a single binary number S without leading zeroes. 

Output:
Print two numbers A and B in one line without leading zeroes. If any number is zero, just print 0.
Constraints

2≤ number of bits in S≤106
The string S has at least 1 one and 1 zero and has exactly two parts: all 1's followed by all 0's.


                        Sample Input 1
                        





1110000



                        Sample Output 1
                        





10000000 10000


Explanation
1110000 is 112 in decimal.
10000000 is 128 in decimal. 10000 is 16 in decimal. 128 - 16 = 112. Hence the given output is valid. The sum of the number of 1's in A and B is 1 + 1 = 2. You can check that this cannot be decreased. Hence this is a correct answer.
