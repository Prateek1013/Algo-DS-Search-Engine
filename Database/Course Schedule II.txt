Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You want to complete nn courses that have requirements of the form "course aa has to be completed before course bb".

You want to complete course 11 as soon as possible. If there are several ways to do this, you want then to complete course 22 as soon as possible, and so on.

Your task is to determine the order in which you complete the courses.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of courses and requirements. The courses are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then, there are mm lines describing the requirements. Each line has two integers aa and bb: course aa has to be completed before course bb.

You can assume that there is at least one valid schedule.

Output

Print one line having nn integers: the order in which you complete the courses.
