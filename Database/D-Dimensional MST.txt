You are given NN points in D-dimensional space. The ith point has D coordinates - xi,1,xi,2,…,xi,D.
Consider a weighted undirected complete graph with these N points as its vertices. Weight of the edge between points i and j is |xi,1−xj,1|+|xi,2−xj,2|+…+|xi,D−xj,D|.
Find the weight of the maximum spanning tree of this graph.
Input:

The first line contains two integers N,D.
The i-th of the next N lines contains a description of the i-th point. It has D integers: xi,1,xi,2,…,xi,D.

Output:
Output a single line which contains a single integer - the Maximum Spanning Tree Weight
