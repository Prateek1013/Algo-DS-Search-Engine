Chef has an array of NN integers [A1,A2,…,AN][A1,A2,…,AN]. He wants to perform MM operations; for each ii (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M), the ii-th operation consists of reversing the subarray [Ali,…,Ari][Ali,…,Ari].
Each operation should be applied exactly once. However, Chef does not remember the order in which they should be applied, so he wants to choose a uniformly random permutation of the MM operations and apply them in that order.
Let's denote by BB the resulting array if the operations are unpermuted, i.e. applied in the order 11 through MM. Find the probability that the resulting array (after Chef applies all operations in a random order) is equal to BB. Specifically, this probability can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/Q, where PP and QQ are coprime positive integers; compute PP and QQ.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers lili and riri.

Output
Print a single line containing two integers PP and QQ, separated by a slash (the character '/').
