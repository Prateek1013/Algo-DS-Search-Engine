Consider an undirected graph that consists of nn nodes and mm edges. There are two types of events that can happen:
A new edge is created between nodes aa and bb.
An existing edge between nodes aa and bb is removed.

Your task is to report the number of components after every event.

Input

The first input line has three integers nn, mm and kk: the number of nodes, edges and events.

After this there are mm lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb. There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes.

Then there are kk lines describing the events. Each line has the form "tt aa bb" where tt is 1 (create a new edge) or 2 (remove an edge). A new edge is always created between two nodes that do not already have an edge between them, and only existing edges can get removed.

Output

Print k+1k+1 integers: first the number of components before the first event, and after this the new number of components after each event.
