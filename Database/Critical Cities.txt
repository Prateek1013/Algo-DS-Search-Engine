Memory limit: 512 MB



There are nn cities and mm flight connections between them. A city is called a critical city if it appears on every route from a city to another city.

Your task is to find all critical cities from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. City 11 is Syrjälä, and city nn is Lehmälä.

Then, there are mm lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is a flight from city aa to city bb. All flights are one-way.

You may assume that there is a route from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.

Output

First print an integer kk: the number of critical cities. After this, print kk integers: the critical cities in increasing order.
