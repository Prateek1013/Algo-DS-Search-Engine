Alice and Bob are playing a game on a binary string SS of length NN.
Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice going first. On their turn, the current player must choose any index 1≤i<|S|1≤i<|S| such that Si≠Si+1 and erase either Si or Si+1 from the string. This reduces the length of S by one, and the remaining parts of S are concatenated in the same order.
The player who is unable to make a move loses.
Determine the winner if both players play optimally.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of the string.
The second line contains the binary string S of length N.

Output Format
For each test case output Alice if Alice wins the game, otherwise output Bob.
The output is not case-sensitive, so for example "Bob", "boB" and "Bob" are all considered equivalent.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤105
S is a binary string
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Bob
Alice
Bob


Explanation
Test Case 1: There is no such index i such that Si≠Si+1. So, Alice does not have any move and loses, making Bob the winner.
Test Case 2: Alice can choose i=2 (because S2=1 and S3=0) and remove S3. After this move, the remaining string is "11". Bob now has no moves and thus loses.
