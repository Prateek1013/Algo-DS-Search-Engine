You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.
There are NN submissions, numbered 11 through NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th submission was submitted at time SiSi and judged at time JiJi (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 55 minutes.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer NN.
NN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers SiSi and JiJi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.

Explanation
Example case 1: The delays of the respective submissions are 22 minutes, 00 minutes, 66 minutes, 1010 minutes and 55 minutes. Only submissions 33 and 44 are delayed by more than 55 minutes, hence the answer is 22.
