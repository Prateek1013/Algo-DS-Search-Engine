B. Mirror in the Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a string s1s2…sns1s2…sn and you stand on the left of the string looking right. You want to choose an index kk (1≤k≤n1≤k≤n) and place a mirror after the kk-th letter, so that what you see is s1s2…sksksk−1…s1s1s2…sksksk−1…s1. What is the lexicographically smallest string you can see?A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds:   aa is a prefix of bb, but a≠ba≠b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb. InputThe first line of input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤100001≤t≤10000): the number of test cases.The next tt lines contain the description of the test cases, two lines per a test case.In the first line you are given one integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105): the length of the string.The second line contains the string ss consisting of nn lowercase English characters.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.OutputFor each test case print the lexicographically smallest string you can see.ExampleInputCopy4

NoteIn the first test case choose k=1k=1 to obtain "cc".In the second test case choose k=3k=3 to obtain "cbaabc".In the third test case choose k=1k=1 to obtain "aa".In the fourth test case choose k=1k=1 to obtain "bb".
