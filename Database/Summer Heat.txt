Chefland has 22 different types of coconut, type AA and type BB. Type AA contains only xaxa milliliters of coconut water and type BB contains only xbxb grams of coconut pulp. Chef's nutritionist has advised him to consume XaXa milliliters of coconut water and XbXb grams of coconut pulp every week in the summer. Find the total number of coconuts (type AA + type BB) that Chef should buy each week to keep himself active in the hot weather.
Input

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains a single line of input, four integers xaxa, xbxb, XaXa, XbXb.

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.

Explanation
TestCase 11: 
Number of coconuts of Type AA required = 1000100=101000100=10 and number of coconuts of Type BB required = 1200400=31200400=3.  So the total number of coconuts required is 10+3=1310+3=13.
TestCase 22: 
Number of coconuts of Type AA required = 1000100=101000100=10 and number of coconuts of Type BB required = 1350450=31350450=3.  So the total number of coconuts required is 10+3=1310+3=13.
TestCase 33: 
Number of coconuts of Type AA required = 1200150=81200150=8 and number of coconuts of Type BB required = 1200400=31200400=3.  So the total number of coconuts required is 8+3=118+3=11.
