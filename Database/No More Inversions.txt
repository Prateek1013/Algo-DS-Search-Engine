NoteIn the first test case, the sequence a=[1]a=[1], there is only one permutation p=[1]p=[1].In the second test case, the sequence a=[1,2]a=[1,2]. There is no inversion in aa, so there is only one permutation p=[1,2]p=[1,2] which doesn't increase the number of inversions.In the third test case, a=[1,2,1]a=[1,2,1] and has 11 inversion. If we use p=[2,1]p=[2,1], then b=[p[a[1]],p[a[2]],p[a[3]]]=[2,1,2]b=[p[a[1]],p[a[2]],p[a[3]]]=[2,1,2] and also has 11 inversion.In the fourth test case, a=[1,2,3,2]a=[1,2,3,2], and since p=[1,3,2]p=[1,3,2] then b=[1,3,2,3]b=[1,3,2,3]. Both aa and bb have 11 inversion and bb is the lexicographically maximum.
