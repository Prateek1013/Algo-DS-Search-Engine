You are given two binary strings SS and PP. You need to convert SS into P using the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Pick three binary values X, Y, and Z, such that at least one of them is equal to 1 and at least one of them is equal to 0. Then, pick three distinct indices i, j, and k, and assign Si=X, Sj=Y, and Sk=Z.

Determine whether it's possible to convert S into P.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains N denoting the length of S and P.
The second line of each test case contains S.
The third line of each test case contains P.

Output Format
For each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to convert S to P, or NO if it is not possible to do so. Output is case insensitive.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
3≤N≤1000
|S|=|P|=N

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO


Explanation

For the first test case, we choose X=0,Y=1 and Z=1. This satisfies the above condition. Three indices (i,j,k) are chosen as (1,2,4), and (A1,A2,A4) are then assigned as (0,1,1) respectively. After this operation, S transforms into 0101.
For the second test case, no set of any operations is possible to make S equals to P.
