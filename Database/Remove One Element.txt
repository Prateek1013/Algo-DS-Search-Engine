D. Remove One Elementtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa consisting of nn integers.You can remove at most one element from this array. Thus, the final length of the array is n−1n−1 or nn.Your task is to calculate the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the remaining array.Recall that the contiguous subarray aa with indices from ll to rr is a[l…r]=al,al+1,…,ara[l…r]=al,al+1,…,ar. The subarray a[l…r]a[l…r] is called strictly increasing if al<al+1<⋯<aral<al+1<⋯<ar.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in aa.The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109), where aiai is the ii-th element of aa.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible length of the strictly increasing contiguous subarray of the array aa after removing at most one element.ExamplesInputCopy5

NoteIn the first example, you can delete a3=5a3=5. Then the resulting array will be equal to [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4] and the length of its largest increasing subarray will be equal to 44.
