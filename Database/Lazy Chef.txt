Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in xx units of time, he finishes it in m∗xm∗x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max dd units of time. Given x,m,dx,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x,m,dx,m,d. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤x,m≤101≤x,m≤10
0≤d<1000≤d<100

Explanation
TestCase 11: Chef takes 1∗1=11∗1=1 unit of time which is equal to the upper bound(1+0=11+0=1 unit) to do the work.   
TestCase 22: Chef takes min(1∗3,1+1)=min(3,2)=2min(1∗3,1+1)=min(3,2)=2 units of time to do the work.   
TestCase 33: Chef takes 2∗2=42∗2=4 units of time which is less than the upper bound(2+3=52+3=5 units) to do the work.
