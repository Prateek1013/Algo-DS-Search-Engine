Nikitosh the painter has a 1-indexed array A of N elements. He wants to find the maximum value of expression 
(A[l1] ⊕ A[l1 + 1] ⊕ ... ⊕ A[r1]) + (A[l2] ⊕ A[l2 + 1] ⊕ ... ⊕ A[r2]) where 1 ≤ l1 ≤ r1 < l2 ≤ r2 ≤ N.
Here, x ⊕ y means the bitwise XOR of x and y.
Because Nikitosh is a painter and not a mathematician, you need to help him in this task.
Input
The first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, denoting A1, A2, ... , AN.
Output
Output a single integer denoting the maximum possible value of the given expression.
