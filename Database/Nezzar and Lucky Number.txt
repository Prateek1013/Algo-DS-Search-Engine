B. Nezzar and Lucky Numbertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNezzar's favorite digit among 1,…,91,…,9 is dd. He calls a positive integer lucky if dd occurs at least once in its decimal representation. Given qq integers a1,a2,…,aqa1,a2,…,aq, for each 1≤i≤q1≤i≤q Nezzar would like to know if aiai can be equal to a sum of several (one or more) lucky numbers.InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤91≤t≤9) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers qq and dd (1≤q≤1041≤q≤104, 1≤d≤91≤d≤9).The second line of each test case contains qq integers a1,a2,…,aqa1,a2,…,aq (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).OutputFor each integer in each test case, print "YES" in a single line if aiai can be equal to a sum of lucky numbers. Otherwise, print "NO".You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInputCopy2
