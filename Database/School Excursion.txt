A group of nn children are coming to Helsinki. There are two possible attractions: a child can visit either Korkeasaari (zoo) or Linnanmäki (amusement park).

There are mm pairs of children who want to visit the same attraction. Your task is to find all possible alternatives for the number of children that will visit Korkeasaari. The children's wishes have to be taken into account.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of children and their wishes. The children are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

After this, there are mm lines describing the children's wishes. Each line has two integers aa and bb: children aa and bb want to visit the same attraction.

Output

Print a bit string of length nn where a one-bit at index ii indicates that it is possible that exactly ii children visit Korkeasaari (the bit string is to be considered one-indexed).
