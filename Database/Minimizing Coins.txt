CSES - Minimizing Coins


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Consider a money system consisting of nn coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money xx using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are {1,5,7}{1,5,7} and the desired sum is 1111, an optimal solution is 5+5+15+5+1 which requires 33 coins.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and xx: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has nn distinct integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn: the value of each coin.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to produce the desired sum, print −1−1.
