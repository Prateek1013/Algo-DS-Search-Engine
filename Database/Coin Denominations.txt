You are given an integer C and an array A = A1,A2,…,AN which has distinct positive integers. It is guaranteed that Ai≤C for 1≤i≤N. You have an infinite supply of coins of denomination Ai for 1≤i≤N. You have another array W=W1,W2,…WN. This denotes that a single coin of denomination Ai has a weight of Wi.
You are given M queries: Q1,Q2,…,QM. You need to get a collection of coins, such that their values add up to exactly Qi (ie. sum of denominations), and the sum of their weights is minimized. Output this minimum weight, or say that it is impossible to get exactly a sum of Qi. As the minimum weight could be huge, output it module 109+7.
Input:

The first line of the input contains three integers: N, C and M.
The i-th of the next N lines contains two numbers Ai and Wi, which have been described above.
The i-th of the next M lines contains a single integer: Qi.

Output:

M lines, each of which should contain a single integer. If it is possible to achieve the queried value, then your output should be the remainder when the minimum total weight is divided by 109+7.
If it is not possible to achieve the exact value in the query, print −1. Note that we do not take modulo anything here.

Constraints

1≤N≤C≤100
1≤M≤106
1≤Ai≤C
Ai≠Aj, if i≠j
1≤Wi≤109
1≤Qi≤1018

Subtasks

12 points : 1≤Qi≤106

Sample Input:
3 100 2
2 50
8 1
3 40
9
7

Sample Output:
120
140

Explanation:
You can get a total value of 9 by taking three coins of denomination 3. Their total weight comes to 3∗40=120. You can check that you cannot do better than this.
You can get a total value of 7 by taking two coins of denomination 2 and one coin of denomination 3 ((2∗2)+3=7). Their total weight comes to (2∗50)+40=140. You can check that you cannot do better than this.
