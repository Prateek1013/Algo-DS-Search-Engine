Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a tree consisting of nn nodes.

Your task is to determine for each node the sum of the distances from the node to all other nodes.

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print nn integers: for each node 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, the sum of the distances.
