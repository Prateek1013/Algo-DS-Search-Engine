The bell rings and every person kills some of people in front of him. All people kill others at the same time. Namely, the i-th person kills the j-th person if and only if j < i and j ≥ i - Li.You are given lengths of the claws. You need to find the total number of alive people after the bell rings.InputThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of guilty people.Second line contains n space-separated integers L1, L2, ..., Ln (0 ≤ Li ≤ 109), where Li is the length of the i-th person's claw.OutputPrint one integer — the total number of alive people after the bell rings.ExamplesInputCopy40 1 0 10OutputCopy1InputCopy20 0OutputCopy2InputCopy101 1 3 0 0 0 2 1 0 3OutputCopy3NoteIn first sample the last person kills everyone in front of him.
