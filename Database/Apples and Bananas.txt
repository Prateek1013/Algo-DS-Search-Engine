There are apples and bananas and each of them has an integer weight between 1…k1…k. Your task is to calculate for each weight ww between 2...2k2...2k the number of ways we can choose an apple and a banana whose combined weight is ww.

Input

The first input line contains three integers kk, nn and mm: the number kk, the number of apples and the number of bananas.

The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an: weight of each apple.

The last line contains mm integers b1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bm: weight of each banana.

Output

For each integer ww between 2…2k2…2k print the number of ways to choose an apple and a banana whose combined weight is ww.
