A. Equatortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has created his own training plan to prepare for the programming contests. He will train for nn days, all days are numbered from 11 to nn, beginning from the first.On the ii-th day Polycarp will necessarily solve aiai problems. One evening Polycarp plans to celebrate the equator. He will celebrate it on the first evening of such a day that from the beginning of the training and to this day inclusive he will solve half or more of all the problems.Determine the index of day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator.InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤2000001≤n≤200000) — the number of days to prepare for the programming contests.The second line contains a sequence a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤100001≤ai≤10000), where aiai equals to the number of problems, which Polycarp will solve on the ii-th day.OutputPrint the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator.ExamplesInputCopy41 3 2 1OutputCopy2InputCopy62 2 2 2 2 2OutputCopy3NoteIn the first example Polycarp will celebrate the equator on the evening of the second day, because up to this day (inclusive) he will solve 44 out of 77 scheduled problems on four days of the training.In the second example Polycarp will celebrate the equator on the evening of the third day, because up to this day (inclusive) he will solve 66 out of 1212 scheduled problems on six days of the training.
