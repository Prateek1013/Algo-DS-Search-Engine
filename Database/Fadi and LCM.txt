C. Fadi and LCMtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday, Osama gave Fadi an integer XX, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of max(a,b)max(a,b) such that LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) equals XX. Both aa and bb should be positive integers.LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both aa and bb. For example, LCM(6,8)=24LCM(6,8)=24, LCM(4,12)=12LCM(4,12)=12, LCM(2,3)=6LCM(2,3)=6.Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?InputThe first and only line contains an integer XX (1≤X≤10121≤X≤1012).OutputPrint two positive integers, aa and bb, such that the value of max(a,b)max(a,b) is minimum possible and LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) equals XX. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.ExamplesInputCopy2
