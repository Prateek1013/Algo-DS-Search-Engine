Note that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for a2a2 and a3a3),  [1,1,1,1023][1,1,1,1023],  [7,39,89,25,89][7,39,89,25,89],  [][]. Note that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of 00) is good.For example, the following sequences are not good:  [16][16] (for a1=16a1=16, it is impossible to find another element ajaj such that their sum is a power of two),  [4,16][4,16] (for a1=4a1=4, it is impossible to find another element ajaj such that their sum is a power of two),  [1,3,2,8,8,8][1,3,2,8,8,8] (for a3=2a3=2, it is impossible to find another element ajaj such that their sum is a power of two). You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.InputThe first line contains the integer nn (1≤n≤1200001≤n≤120000) — the length of the given sequence.The second line contains the sequence of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).OutputPrint the minimum number of elements needed to be removed from the given sequence in order to make it good. It is possible that you need to delete all nn elements, make it empty, and thus get a good sequence.ExamplesInputCopy64 7 1 5 4 9OutputCopy1InputCopy51 2 3 4 5OutputCopy2InputCopy116OutputCopy1InputCopy41 1 1 1023OutputCopy0NoteIn the first example, it is enough to delete one element a4=5a4=5. The remaining elements form the sequence [4,7,1,4,9][4,7,1,4,9], which is good.
