Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to create a permutation of numbers 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n that has exactly kk inversions.

An inversion is a pair (a,b)(a,b) where a<ba<b and pa>pbpa>pb where pipi denotes the number at position ii in the permutation.

Input

The only input line has two integers nn and kk.

Output

Print a line that contains the permutation. You can print any valid solution.
