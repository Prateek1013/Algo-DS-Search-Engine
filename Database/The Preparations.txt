Explanation
Test Case 11: The duration of the only episode is 1010 minutes, and the exam starts exactly after 1010 minutes. So, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-11 strictly before the exam starts.
Test Case 22: There are two episodes in Season-11, each of duration 1010 minutes. Therefore, Chef will require 10+10=2010+10=20 minutes to finish watching Season-11. As the exam starts after 2525 minutes, Chef will be able to finish watching Season-11 strictly before the exam starts.
Test Case 33: There are two episodes in Season-11, each of duration 1010 minutes. Therefore, Chef will require 10+10=2010+10=20 minutes to finish watchin Season-11. As the exam starts after 1515 minutes, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-11 strictly before the exam starts.
