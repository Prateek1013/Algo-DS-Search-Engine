CSES - Cyclic Array


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a cyclic array consisting of nn values. Each element has two neighbors; the elements at positions nn and 11 are also considered neighbors.

Your task is to divide the array into subarrays so that the sum of each subarray is at most kk. What is the minimum number of subarrays?

Input

The first input line contains integers nn and kk.

The next line has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

There is always at least one division (i.e., no value in the array is larger than kk).

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of subarrays.

Constraints

 1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105
 1≤xi≤1091≤xi≤109
 1≤k≤10181≤k≤1018

Example

Input:
8 5
2 2 2 1 3 1 2 1

Output:
3

Explanation: We can create three subarrays: [2,2,1][2,2,1], [3,1][3,1], and [2,1,2][2,1,2] (remember that the array is cyclic).
