Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given an array of nn integers. Your task is to calculate for each window of kk elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal.

You can increase or decrease each element with cost xx where xx is the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs.

Input

The first input line contains two integers nn and kk: the number of elements and the size of the window.

Then there are nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Output

Output n−k+1n−k+1 values: the costs.
