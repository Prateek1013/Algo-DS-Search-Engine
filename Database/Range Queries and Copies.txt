Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to maintain a list of arrays which initially has a single array. You have to process the following types of queries:
Set the value aa in array kk to xx.
Calculate the sum of values in range [a,b][a,b] in array kk.
Create a copy of array kk and add it to the end of the list.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the array size and the number of queries.

The next line has nn integers t1,t2,…,tnt1,t2,…,tn: the initial contents of the array.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1 kk aa xx", "2 kk aa bb" or "3 kk".

Output

Print the answer to each sum query.
