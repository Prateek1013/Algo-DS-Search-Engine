Explanation
Test case 11: The total income is 50×2=10050×2=100 coins. The juicer spends 2020 coins on sugarcane, 2020 coins on  salt and mint leaves and 3030 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is 100−(20+20+30)=30100−(20+20+30)=30 coins. 
Test case 22: The total income is 50×4=20050×4=200 coins. The juicer spends 4040 coins on sugarcane, 4040 coins on  salt and mint leaves and 6060 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is 200−(40+40+60)=60200−(40+40+60)=60 coins. 
Test case 33: The total income is 50×5=25050×5=250 coins. The juicer spends 5050 coins on sugarcane, 5050 coins on  salt and mint leaves and 7575 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is 250−(50+50+75)=75250−(50+50+75)=75 coins. 
Test case 44: The total income is 50×10=50050×10=500 coins. The juicer spends 100100 coins on sugarcane, 100100 coins on  salt and mint leaves and 150150 coins on rent. Thus, the profit is 500−(100+100+150)=150500−(100+100+150)=150 coins.
