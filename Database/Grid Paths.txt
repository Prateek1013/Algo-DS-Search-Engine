CSES - Grid Paths


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Consider an n×nn×n grid whose top-left square is (1,1)(1,1) and bottom-right square is (n,n)(n,n).

Your task is to move from the top-left square to the bottom-right square. On each step you may move one square right or down. In addition, there are mm traps in the grid. You cannot move to a square with a trap.

What is the total number of possible paths?

Input

The first input line contains two integers nn and mm: the size of the grid and the number of traps.

After this, there are mm lines describing the traps. Each such line contains two integers yy and xx: the location of a trap.

You can assume that there are no traps in the top-left and bottom-right square.

Output

Print the number of paths modulo 109+7109+7.
