There is a secret sequence A1,A2,…,AN. We do not know the elements of this sequence, but we know another sequence B1,B2,…,BN−1 such that Bi=Ai+Ai+1 for each valid i.
You should process Q queries. In each query, you are given two indices p and q; your task is to compute Ap+Aq or determine that there is not enough information to uniquely determine this sum.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN−1.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers p and q describing a query.

Output
For each query, if it is impossible to determine the required sum, print a single line containing the string "UNKNOWN". Otherwise, print a single line containing one integer — the required sum.
