Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a range of positive integers L,L+1,…RL,L+1,…R. Find an integer XX greater than 11 which is coprime with all the integers in this range (does not share any common factors greater than 1 with any of these integers). In addition, X must not exceed 2⋅109.
If there are multiple solutions satisfying these conditions, you may find any one of them. It is guaranteed that for the given constraints, at least one such integer X exists.
For example, if L=16 and R=17, then X=9 is coprime with both 16 and 17. However, if L=6 and R=12 instead, then X=9 shares a common factor 3 with 6 and 12 and a common factor 9 with 9.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer X which satisfies the above conditions.
Constraints
