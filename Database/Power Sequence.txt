Find the minimum cost to transform a0,a1,...,an−1a0,a1,...,an−1 into a power sequence.InputThe first line contains an integer nn (3≤n≤1053≤n≤105).The second line contains nn integers a0,a1,...,an−1a0,a1,...,an−1 (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).OutputPrint the minimum cost to transform a0,a1,...,an−1a0,a1,...,an−1 into a power sequence.ExamplesInputCopy3

NoteIn the first example, we first reorder {1,3,2}{1,3,2} into {1,2,3}{1,2,3}, then increment a2a2 to 44 with cost 11 to get a power sequence {1,2,4}{1,2,4}.
