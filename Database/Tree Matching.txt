Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a tree consisting of nn nodes.

A matching is a set of edges where each node is an endpoint of at most one edge. What is the maximum number of edges in a matching?

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print one integer: the maximum number of pairs.

Example

Input:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
2

Explanation: One possible matching is (1,2)(1,2) and (3,4)(3,4).
