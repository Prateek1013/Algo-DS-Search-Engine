A binary string SS of length NN is called KK-balanced string if it holds the following property: For each index i(1≤i≤N) such that Si= '1', there must exist an index j(1≤j≤N) such that Sj= '1'  and ∣i−j∣=K, where ∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of x.
For example, if K=1, "00", "110", "011011" are 1-balanced strings, while "010" , "1001" are not; if K=2, "10101", "0101000101" are 2-balanced strings, while "0110" , "1001", "010" are not. 
Chef is given a binary string S of length N and an integer K. He can perform the following operation on the string:

Select an index of the string, and flip the character at that index. This means if the character was "0", it becomes "1", and vice versa.

What is the minimum number of operations Chef will have to perform so that the string becomes K-balanced?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.
The second line of each test case contains a string S.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number operation Chef needs to perform on the given string to make it K-balanced.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
1≤K≤N
S contains only characters '0' and '1'.
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation
Test case 1: Chef applies one operation on the index 2 and the string becomes "00" which is a 1-balanced string.
Test case 2: The given string is already 1-balanced.
Test case 3: Chef applies one operation on the index 3 and the string becomes "1111" which is a 2-balanced string.
Test case 4: Chef applies one operation on the index 2 and another operation on the index 3. Hence, the string becomes "10010" which is a 3-balanced string.
