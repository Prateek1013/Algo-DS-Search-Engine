A. Sweet Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have three piles of candies: red, green and blue candies:  the first pile contains only red candies and there are rr candies in it,  the second pile contains only green candies and there are gg candies in it,  the third pile contains only blue candies and there are bb candies in it. Each day Tanya eats exactly two candies of different colors. She is free to choose the colors of eaten candies: the only restriction that she can't eat two candies of the same color in a day.Find the maximal number of days Tanya can eat candies? Each day she needs to eat exactly two candies.InputThe first line contains integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.Each test case is given as a separate line of the input. It contains three integers rr, gg and bb (1≤r,g,b≤1081≤r,g,b≤108) — the number of red, green and blue candies, respectively.OutputPrint tt integers: the ii-th printed integer is the answer on the ii-th test case in the input.ExampleInputCopy6
