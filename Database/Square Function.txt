Let's define a function F(X)F(X) as follows: 
F(X)=XYF(X)=XY 
where YY is the largest perfect square that divides X. 
For example,

The largest perfect square that divides 12 is 4. Hence F(12)=124=3.
The largest perfect square that divides 36 is 36. Hence F(36)=3636=1.
The largest perfect square that divides 7 is 1. Hence F(7)=71=7.

You are given an array A consisting of N integers. A pair of integer (i, j) is called Good if 1≤i<j≤N and  F(Ai∗Aj)>1. Find the number of Good pairs.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. 

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of Good pairs.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤106
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation
Test case 1: 

(i=1,j=2): F(A1∗A2)=F(2∗3)=F(6)=61=6>1. 
(i=1,j=3): F(A1∗A3)=F(2∗12)=F(24)=244=6>1.
(i=2,j=3): F(A2∗A3)=F(3∗12)=F(36)=3636=1≯1.
So there are 2 Good pairs.

Test case 2:  All pairs except (1,4) are Good pairs as F(A1∗A4)=F(1∗4)=F(4)=44=1≯1. 
Test case 3:  All pairs are Good pairs.
