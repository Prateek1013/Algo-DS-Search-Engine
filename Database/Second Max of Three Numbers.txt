Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the second-maximum number among the three.

Input

First line contains the number of triples, N.
The next N lines which follow each have three space separated integers.

Output
For each of the N triples, output one new line which contains the second-maximum integer among the three.
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 6
1 ≤ every integer ≤ 10000
The three integers in a single triplet are all distinct. That is, no two of them are equal.

Sample Input
