You are given a single integer N. It's very large, so it's given as a product of several prime powers: N = p1k1 p2k2 ... pmkm.

Let's define φ(N) as Euler's totient function -- the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are relatively prime to N.

Let N1 = φ(N). Let N2 = φ(N1). Further, let NX = φ(NX-1) for X > 2.

Your task is to find the smallest positive integer X such that NX = 1. Only careful calculation might help... or will it be enough?

Input
The first line of the input file contains one integer T -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case is described by a line containing one positive integer m followed by m lines, each containing two integers pi and ki (1 < pi < 100000, 1 ≤ ki ≤ 109) separated by a single space. It's guaranteed that all pi are pairwise distinct prime numbers in each test case (note that the upper limit on m can be determined from this constraint).

Output
For each test case output just one line containing the required smallest positive integer X.

Example
Input:
1
2
2 2
3 1

Output:
3

Explanation:

In the example test case N = 22*31 = 12. Then N1 = 4, N2 = 2 and NX = 1 for X ≥ 3, so the answer is 3.
