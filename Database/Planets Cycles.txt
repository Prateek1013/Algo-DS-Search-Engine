You are playing a game consisting of nn planets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself).

You start on a planet and then travel through teleporters until you reach a planet that you have already visited before.

Your task is to calculate for each planet the number of teleportations there would be if you started on that planet.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of planets. The planets are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The second line has nn integers t1,t2,…,tnt1,t2,…,tn: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. It is possible that ti=iti=i.

Output

Print nn integers according to the problem statement.
