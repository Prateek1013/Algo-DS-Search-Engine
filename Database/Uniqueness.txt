B. Uniquenesstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. You can remove at most one subsegment from it. The remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.In other words, at most one time you can choose two integers ll and rr (1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n) and delete integers al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar from the array. Remaining elements should be pairwise distinct. Find the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all remaining elements distinct.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤20001≤n≤2000) — the number of elements in the given array.The next line contains nn spaced integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array. OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all elements of the array pairwise distinct. If no subsegment needs to be removed, print 00.ExamplesInputCopy3

NoteIn the first example all the elements are already distinct, therefore no subsegment needs to be removed.In the second example you can remove the subsegment from index 22 to 33.In the third example you can remove the subsegments from index 11 to 22, or from index 22 to 33, or from index 33 to 44.
