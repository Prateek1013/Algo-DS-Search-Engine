There is an n×nn×n grid whose each square has some number of coins in it.

You know for each row and column how many squares you must choose from that row or column. You get all coins from every square you choose. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect and how could you choose the squares so that the given conditions are satisfied?

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the size of the grid. The rows and columns are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The next line has nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an: You must choose exactly aiai squares from the iith row.

The next line has nn integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn: You must choose exactly bjbj squares from the jjth column.

Finally, there are nn lines describing the grid. You can assume The sums of a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn are equal.

Output

First print an integer kk: the maximum number of coins you can collect. After this print nn lines describing which squares you choose (X means that you choose a square, . means that you don't choose it).

If it is not possible to satisfy the conditions print only −1−1.
