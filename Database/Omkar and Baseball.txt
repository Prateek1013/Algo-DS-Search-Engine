C. Omkar and Baseballtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPatrick likes to play baseball, but sometimes he will spend so many hours hitting home runs that his mind starts to get foggy! Patrick is sure that his scores across nn sessions follow the identity permutation (ie. in the first game he scores 11 point, in the second game he scores 22 points and so on). However, when he checks back to his record, he sees that all the numbers are mixed up! Define a special exchange as the following: choose any subarray of the scores and permute elements such that no element of subarray gets to the same position as it was before the exchange. For example, performing a special exchange on [1,2,3][1,2,3] can yield [3,1,2][3,1,2] but it cannot yield [3,2,1][3,2,1] since the 22 is in the same position. Given a permutation of nn integers, please help Patrick find the minimum number of special exchanges needed to make the permutation sorted! It can be proved that under given constraints this number doesn't exceed 10181018.An array aa is a subarray of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105)  — the length of the given permutation.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,...,ana1,a2,...,an (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n)  — the initial permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.OutputFor each test case, output one integer: the minimum number of special exchanges needed to sort the permutation.ExampleInputCopy2

NoteIn the first permutation, it is already sorted so no exchanges are needed.It can be shown that you need at least 22 exchanges to sort the second permutation.[3,2,4,5,1,6,7][3,2,4,5,1,6,7]Perform special exchange on range (1,51,5)[4,1,2,3,5,6,7][4,1,2,3,5,6,7]Perform special exchange on range (1,41,4)[1,2,3,4,5,6,7][1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
