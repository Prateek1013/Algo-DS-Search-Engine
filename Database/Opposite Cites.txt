There are NN cities on a circle, numbered 11 through NN. For each i (1≤i≤N−1), cities i and i+1 are directly connected by a bidirectional road with length Ai, and cities N and 1 are also directly connected by a bidirectional road with length AN. However, we do not know the lengths of some roads.
For each city i, we do know that it has an opposite city — formally, there is a city j≠i such that the clockwise distance between cities i and j is equal to the counterclockwise distance between these cities.
Please find the lengths of all roads in such a way that the above condition is satisfied and the sum of lengths of all roads is minimised.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. For each valid i, Ai=−1 denotes that the length of road i is unknown.

Output
For each test case, print a line containing the string "NO" if there is no solution or "YES" otherwise. If a solution exists, print a second line containing N space-separated positive integers — the lengths of all roads in your solution. Each of these integers should be ≤109. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
3≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109 or Ai=−1 for each valid i
the sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N≤4
Subtask #2 (20 points): Ai=±1 for each valid i
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints
