CSES - Distinct Routes II


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



A game consists of nn rooms and mm teleporters. At the beginning of each day, you start in room 11 and you have to reach room nn.

You can use each teleporter at most once during the game. You want to play the game for exactly kk days. Every time you use any teleporter you have to pay one coin. What is the minimum number of coins you have to pay during kk days if you play optimally?

Input

The first input line has three integers nn, mm and kk: the number of rooms, the number of teleporters and the number of days you play the game. The rooms are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

After this, there are mm lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is a teleporter from room aa to room bb.

There are no two teleporters whose starting and ending room are the same.

Output

First print one integer: the minimum number of coins you have to pay if you play optimally. Then, print kk route descriptions according to the example. You can print any valid solution.

If it is not possible to play the game for kk days, print only -1.
