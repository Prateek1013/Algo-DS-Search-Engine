Bob has a string  (S), which is initially empty. In one operation, he can select a lowercase character (a-z) uniformly at random and appends it to S. He then evaluates whether S is a palindrome or not; if it is, he gets 1 point.


Given that Bob performs N operations in total, find the expected no. of points Bob gets.

It is guaranteed that the answer can always be represented as a rational number abab. You must print this number modulo 1000000007. By this we mean that you must print, a×b−1a×b−1 modulo 1000000007 where b−1b−1 denotes the modulo inverse of b with respect to 1000000007.
 

Also observe that 1000000007 is a prime number.

Input
First line of the input will contain T denoting the number of test-cases.For every test case, first line will contain N. 
Output
•	For every test case, print the required answer in a separate line  % 10^9+7.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000

Explanation
For n = 2, the answer is 27/26 points.
We have to print this number modulo 1000000007 which equals 27 * 26 −1 % 1000000007 = 576923082.
