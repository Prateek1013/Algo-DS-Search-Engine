You are given an integer N. Let K be a divisor of N of your choice such that K>1, and let M=NK. You need to find the smallest K such that M has as many divisors as possible.
Note: U is a divisor of V if V is divisible by U.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line minimum value of K such that M has as many divisors as possible.
Constraints

1≤T≤3000
2≤N≤109

Explanation

Test case 1: The only possible value for K is 3, and that is the answer.
Test case 2: There are two cases:
K=2. Then M=42=2, which has 2 divisors (1 and 2).
K=4. Then M=44=1, which has 1 divisor (1).

Therefore the answer is 2.

Test case 3: There are three cases:
K=2. Then M=62=3, which has 2 divisors (1 and 3).
K=3. Then M=63=2, which has 2 divisors (1 and 2).
K=6. Then M=66=1, which has 1 divisor (1).

Therefore the answer is 2.
