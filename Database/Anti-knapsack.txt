You are given two integers NN and KK.
Construct an array AA consisting of N distinct positive integers such that the following conditions are met:

1≤Ai≤2⋅104;
There exists no subsequence of A with sum K.

It can be shown that the answer always exists.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T: the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers N and K - as mentioned in the statement.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated elements: A1,A2,…,AN. If there are multiple answers, you may print any.
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤N≤1000
1≤K≤106

Explanation
Test case 1: A=[1,2,5,6]. All elements of the array are distinct. Also, 1≤Ai≤2⋅104, and there isn't any subsequence of the array with sum 10.
Some other valid answers are: [2,6,5,1] and [3,27,869,541].
Test case 2: A=[327,8695,4,19852,14,736,46,15,37,928]. All elements of the array are distinct. Also, 1≤Ai≤2⋅104, and there isn't any subsequence of the array with sum 1000000.
