B. Phoenix and Beautytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPhoenix loves beautiful arrays. An array is beautiful if all its subarrays of length kk have the same sum. A subarray of an array is any sequence of consecutive elements.Phoenix currently has an array aa of length nn. He wants to insert some number of integers, possibly zero, into his array such that it becomes beautiful. The inserted integers must be between 11 and nn inclusive. Integers may be inserted anywhere (even before the first or after the last element), and he is not trying to minimize the number of inserted integers.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤501≤t≤50) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1≤k≤n≤1001≤k≤n≤100).The second line of each test case contains nn space-separated integers (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n) — the array that Phoenix currently has. This array may or may not be already beautiful.OutputFor each test case, if it is impossible to create a beautiful array, print -1. Otherwise, print two lines.The first line should contain the length of the beautiful array mm (n≤m≤104n≤m≤104). You don't need to minimize mm.The second line should contain mm space-separated integers (1≤bi≤n1≤bi≤n) — a beautiful array that Phoenix can obtain after inserting some, possibly zero, integers into his array aa. You may print integers that weren't originally in array aa.If there are multiple solutions, print any. It's guaranteed that if we can make array aa beautiful, we can always make it with resulting length no more than 104104.ExampleInputCopy4

Now, all subarrays of length k=2k=2 have the same sum 33. There exists many other possible solutions, for example:   2,1,2,1,2,12,1,2,1,2,1  1,2,1,2,1,21,2,1,2,1,2 In the second test case, the array is already beautiful: all subarrays of length k=3k=3 have the same sum 55.In the third test case, it can be shown that we cannot insert numbers to make array aa beautiful.In the fourth test case, the array bb shown is beautiful and all subarrays of length k=4k=4 have the same sum 1010. There exist other solutions also.
