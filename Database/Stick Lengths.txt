Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



There are nn sticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length.

You can either lengthen and shorten each stick. Both operations cost xx where xx is the difference between the new and original length.

What is the minimum total cost?

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of sticks.

Then there are nn integers: p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn: the lengths of the sticks.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum total cost.
