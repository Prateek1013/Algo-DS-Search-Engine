C. Vasya and Golden Tickettime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of nn digits a1a2…ana1a2…an. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket 350178350178 is lucky since it can be divided into three segments 350350, 1717 and 88: 3+5+0=1+7=83+5+0=1+7=8. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.InputThe first line contains one integer nn (2≤n≤1002≤n≤100) — the number of digits in the ticket.The second line contains nn digits a1a2…ana1a2…an (0≤ai≤90≤ai≤9) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.OutputIf the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).ExamplesInputCopy573452OutputCopyYESInputCopy41248OutputCopyNONoteIn the first example the ticket can be divided into 77, 3434 and 5252: 7=3+4=5+27=3+4=5+2.In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
