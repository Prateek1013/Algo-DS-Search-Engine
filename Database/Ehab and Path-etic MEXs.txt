C. Ehab and Path-etic MEXstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree consisting of nn nodes. You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:  Every label is an integer between 00 and n−2n−2 inclusive.  All the written labels are distinct.  The largest value among MEX(u,v)MEX(u,v) over all pairs of nodes (u,v)(u,v) is as small as possible. Here, MEX(u,v)MEX(u,v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node uu to node vv.InputThe first line contains the integer nn (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105) — the number of nodes in the tree.Each of the next n−1n−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n) that mean there's an edge between nodes uu and vv. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputOutput n−1n−1 integers. The ithith of them will be the number written on the ithith edge (in the input order).ExamplesInputCopy3
