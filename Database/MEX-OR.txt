The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:

The MEX of [2,2,1][2,2,1] is 00, because 00 does not belong to the array.
The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not.
The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 because 0,1,2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not.

Find the maximum possible MEX of an array of non-negative integers such that the bitwise OR of the elements in the array does not exceed X.
Input Format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer X on a single line.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the maximum possible MEX of the array satisfying the given property.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
0≤X≤109

Explanation
Test case 1: The array could be [0]. 
Test case 2: The array could be [0,1]. Here the bitwise OR of 0 and 1 is 1 and the MEX of the array is 2 as both 0 and 1 belongs to the array.
Test case 4: The array could be [1,0,3,2]. Here the bitwise OR of all integers in the array is 3 and the MEX of the array is 4.
