Your task is to find the kk shortest flight routes from Syrjälä to Metsälä. A route can visit the same city several times.

Note that there can be several routes with the same price and each of them should be considered (see the example).

Input

The first input line has three integers nn, mm, and kk: the number of cities, the number of flights, and the parameter kk. The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. City 1 is Syrjälä, and city nn is Metsälä.

After this, the input has mm lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers aa, bb, and cc: a flight begins at city aa, ends at city bb, and its price is cc. All flights are one-way flights.

You may assume that there are at least kk distinct routes from Syrjälä to Metsälä.

Output

Print kk integers: the prices of the kk cheapest routes sorted according to their prices.
