CSES - Substring Order I


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a string of length nn. If all of its distinct substrings are ordered lexicographically, what is the kkth smallest of them?

Input

The first input line has a string of length nn that consists of characters a–z.

The second input line has an integer kk.

Output

Print the kkth smallest distinct substring in lexicographical order.

Constraints

1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
1≤k≤n(n+1)21≤k≤n(n+1)2
It is guaranteed that kk does not exceed the number of distinct substrings.

Example

Input:
babaacbaab
10

Output:
aba

Explanation: The 10 smallest distinct substrings in order are a, aa, aab, aac, aacb, aacba, aacbaa, aacbaab, ab, and aba.
