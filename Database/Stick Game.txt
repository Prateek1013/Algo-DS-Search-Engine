Memory limit: 512 MB



Consider a game where two players remove sticks from a heap. The players move alternately, and the player who removes the last stick wins the game.

A set P={p1,p2,…,pk}P={p1,p2,…,pk} determines the allowed moves. For example, if P={1,3,4}P={1,3,4}, a player may remove 11, 33 or 44 sticks.

Your task is find out for each number of sticks 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n if the first player has a winning or losing position.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and kk: the number of sticks and moves.

The next line has kk integers p1,p2,…,pkp1,p2,…,pk that describe the allowed moves. All integers are distinct, and one of them is 11.

Output

Print a string containing nn characters: W means a winning position, and L means a losing position.
