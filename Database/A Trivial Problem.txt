B. A Trivial Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?InputThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.OutputFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.ExamplesInputCopy1OutputCopy55 6 7 8 9 InputCopy5OutputCopy0NoteThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
