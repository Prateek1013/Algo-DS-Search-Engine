B. Nauuo and Chesstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNauuo is a girl who loves playing chess.One day she invented a game by herself which needs nn chess pieces to play on a m×mm×m chessboard. The rows and columns are numbered from 11 to mm. We denote a cell on the intersection of the rr-th row and cc-th column as (r,c)(r,c).The game's goal is to place nn chess pieces numbered from 11 to nn on the chessboard, the ii-th piece lies on (ri,ci)(ri,ci), while the following rule is satisfied: for all pairs of pieces ii and jj, |ri−rj|+|ci−cj|≥|i−j||ri−rj|+|ci−cj|≥|i−j|. Here |x||x| means the absolute value of xx.However, Nauuo discovered that sometimes she couldn't find a solution because the chessboard was too small.She wants to find the smallest chessboard on which she can put nn pieces according to the rules.She also wonders how to place the pieces on such a chessboard. Can you help her?InputThe only line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤10001≤n≤1000) — the number of chess pieces for the game.OutputThe first line contains a single integer — the minimum value of mm, where mm is the length of sides of the suitable chessboard.The ii-th of the next nn lines contains two integers riri and cici (1≤ri,ci≤m1≤ri,ci≤m) — the coordinates of the ii-th chess piece.If there are multiple answers, print any.ExamplesInputCopy2

3 3NoteIn the first example, you can't place the two pieces on a 1×11×1 chessboard without breaking the rule. But you can place two pieces on a 2×22×2 chessboard like this:In the second example, you can't place four pieces on a 2×22×2 chessboard without breaking the rule. For example, if you place the pieces like this:then |r1−r3|+|c1−c3|=|1−2|+|1−1|=1|r1−r3|+|c1−c3|=|1−2|+|1−1|=1, |1−3|=2|1−3|=2, 1<21<2; and |r1−r4|+|c1−c4|=|1−2|+|1−2|=2|r1−r4|+|c1−c4|=|1−2|+|1−2|=2, |1−4|=3|1−4|=3, 2<32<3. It doesn't satisfy the rule.However, on a 3×33×3 chessboard, you can place four pieces like this:
