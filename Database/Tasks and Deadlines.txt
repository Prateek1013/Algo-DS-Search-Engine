CSES - Tasks and Deadlines


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You have to process nn tasks. Each task has a duration and a deadline, and you will process the tasks in some order one after another. Your reward for a task is d−fd−f where dd is its deadline and ff is your finishing time. (The starting time is 00, and you have to process all tasks even if a task would yield negative reward.)

What is your maximum reward if you act optimally?

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of tasks.

After this, there are nn lines that describe the tasks. Each line has two integers aa and dd: the duration and deadline of the task.

Output

Print one integer: the maximum reward.
