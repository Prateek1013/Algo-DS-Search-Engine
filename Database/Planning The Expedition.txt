B. Planning The Expeditiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNatasha is planning an expedition to Mars for nn people. One of the important tasks is to provide food for each participant.The warehouse has mm daily food packages. Each package has some food type aiai.Each participant must eat exactly one food package each day. Due to extreme loads, each participant must eat the same food type throughout the expedition. Different participants may eat different (or the same) types of food.Formally, for each participant jj Natasha should select his food type bjbj and each day jj-th participant will eat one food package of type bjbj. The values bjbj for different participants may be different.What is the maximum possible number of days the expedition can last, following the requirements above?InputThe first line contains two integers nn and mm (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100, 1≤m≤1001≤m≤100) — the number of the expedition participants and the number of the daily food packages available.The second line contains sequence of integers a1,a2,…,ama1,a2,…,am (1≤ai≤1001≤ai≤100), where aiai is the type of ii-th food package.OutputPrint the single integer — the number of days the expedition can last. If it is not possible to plan the expedition for even one day, print 0.ExamplesInputCopy4 101 5 2 1 1 1 2 5 7 2OutputCopy2InputCopy100 11OutputCopy0InputCopy2 55 4 3 2 1OutputCopy1InputCopy3 942 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42OutputCopy3NoteIn the first example, Natasha can assign type 11 food to the first participant, the same type 11 to the second, type 55 to the third and type 22 to the fourth. In this case, the expedition can last for 22 days, since each participant can get two food packages of his food type (there will be used 44 packages of type 11, two packages of type 22 and two packages of type 55).In the second example, there are 100100 participants and only 11 food package. In this case, the expedition can't last even 11 day.
