D. Binary String To Subsequencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string ss consisting of nn zeros and ones.Your task is to divide the given string into the minimum number of subsequences in such a way that each character of the string belongs to exactly one subsequence and each subsequence looks like "010101 ..." or "101010 ..." (i.e. the subsequence should not contain two adjacent zeros or ones).Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, subsequences of "1011101" are "0", "1", "11111", "0111", "101", "1001", but not "000", "101010" and "11100".You have to answer tt independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤2⋅1041≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of ss. The second line of the test case contains nn characters '0' and '1' — the string ss.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105∑n≤2⋅105).OutputFor each test case, print the answer: in the first line print one integer kk (1≤k≤n1≤k≤n) — the minimum number of subsequences you can divide the string ss to. In the second line print nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤k1≤ai≤k), where aiai is the number of subsequence the ii-th character of ss belongs to.If there are several answers, you can print any.ExampleInputCopy4
