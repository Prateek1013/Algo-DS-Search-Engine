Given an array of nn integers : A1,A2,...,AnA1,A2,...,An, find the longest size subsequence which satisfies the following property: The xor of adjacent integers in the subsequence must be non-decreasing.
Input:

First line contains an integer nn, denoting the length of the array. 
Second line will contain n space separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Output a single integer denoting the longest size of subsequence with the given property.
Constraints

1≤n≤103
0≤Ai≤1018

Sample Input:
8
1 200 3 0 400 4 1 7

Sample Output:
6

EXPLANATION:
The subsequence of maximum length is {1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 7} with Xor of adjacent indexes as {2,3,4,5,6} (non-decreasing)
