CSES - Monotone Subsequences


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to create a permutation of numbers 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n whose longest monotone subsequence has exactly kk elements.

A monotone subsequence is either increasing or decreasing. For example, some monotone subsequences in [2,1,4,5,3][2,1,4,5,3] are [2,4,5][2,4,5] and [4,3][4,3].

Input

The first input line has an integer tt: the number of tests.

After this, there are tt lines. Each line has two integers nn and kk.

Output

For each test, print a line that contains the permutation. You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
