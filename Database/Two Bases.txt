A. Two Basestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.InputThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.OutputOutput a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y ExamplesInputCopy6 21 0 1 1 1 12 104 7OutputCopy=InputCopy3 31 0 22 52 4OutputCopy<InputCopy7 1615 15 4 0 0 7 107 94 8 0 3 1 5 0OutputCopy>NoteIn the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.In the third sample,  and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
