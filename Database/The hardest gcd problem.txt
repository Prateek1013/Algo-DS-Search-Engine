You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN of positive integers and an integer KK. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

choose an index jj between 11 and N inclusive
choose a positive divisor d of Aj such that d≤K
divide Aj by d

Determine if it is possible to modify the sequence A in such a way that it would satisfy the following condition: there is no positive integer strictly greater than 1 which divides every element of A. (In other words, the greatest common divisor of all elements of A should be 1.)
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the GCD of all elements of A equal to 1 or "NO" if it is impossible.
