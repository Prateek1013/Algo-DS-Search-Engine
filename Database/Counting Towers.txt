CSES - Counting Towers


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to build a tower whose width is 22 and height is nn. You have an unlimited supply of blocks whose width and height are integers.

For example, here are some possible solutions for n=6n=6:

Given nn, how many different towers can you build? Mirrored and rotated towers are counted separately if they look different.

Input

The first input line contains an integer tt: the number of tests.

After this, there are tt lines, and each line contains an integer nn: the height of the tower.

Output

For each test, print the number of towers modulo 109+7109+7.

Constraints
