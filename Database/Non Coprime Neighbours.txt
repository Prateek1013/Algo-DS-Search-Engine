An array BB of length NN (N≥2)(N≥2) is said to be good if the following conditions hold:

For all 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N, 2≤Bi≤106 
gcd(Bi−1,Bi)≠1 for all i (2≤i≤N).

You have an array A of length N (2≤Ai≤105). You want to make the array A good.
To do so, you can change atmost ⌈2⋅N3⌉ elements of A. 
Print the final array after changing A to a good array. If there are multiple possible final arrays, print any of them.
It is guaranteed that A can be made good  after changing atmost ⌈2⋅N3⌉ elements of A.  
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN representing the initial array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the final array after converting A to a good array. The i-th of these N integers is i-th element in the final array. 
If multiple arrays exist which satisfy the conditions, print any of them.
Note: Final array should differ from original array at atmost ⌈2⋅N3⌉indices.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
2≤Ai≤105
Sum of N does not exceed 2⋅105 over all testcases

Explanation
Test Case 1: We can change A3 to 8. Now, A is good since gcd(A1,A2)=6 and gcd(A2,A3)=4. Hence, we made A good after making only 1 change which is ≤⌈2⋅N3⌉.
Test Case 2: Array A is already good.
