Consider a network consisting of nn computers and mm connections. Each connection specifies how fast a computer can send data to another computer.

Kotivalo wants to download some data from a server. What is the maximum speed he can do this, using the connections in the network?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of computers and connections. The computers are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. Computer 11 is the server and computer nn is Kotivalo's computer.

After this, there are mm lines describing the connections. Each line has three integers aa, bb and cc: computer aa can send data to computer bb at speed cc.

Output

Print one integer: the maximum speed Kotivalo can download data.
