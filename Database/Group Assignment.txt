Chef's professor is planning to give his class a group assignment. There are 2N2N students in the class, with distinct roll numbers ranging from 11 to 2N2N. Chef's roll number is XX.
The professor decided to create NN groups of 22 students each. The groups were created as follows: the first group consists of roll numbers 11 and 2N2N, the second group of roll numbers 22 and 2N−12N−1, and so on, with the final group consisting of roll numbers NN and N+1N+1.
Chef wonders who his partner will be. Can you help Chef by telling him the roll number of his partner?

Explanation
Test case 11: The groups will be {(1,4),(2,3)}{(1,4),(2,3)}. Chef's roll number is 22, so his partner's roll number will be 33.
Test case 22: The groups will be {(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}. Chef's roll number is 11, so his partner's roll number will be 66.
Test case 33: The groups will be {(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}. Chef's roll number is 44, so his partner's roll number will be 33.
