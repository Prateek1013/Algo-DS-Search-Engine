Your task is to process qq queries of the form: when you begin on planet xx and travel through kk teleporters, which planet will you reach?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the number of planets and queries. The planets are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The second line has nn integers t1,t2,…,tnt1,t2,…,tn: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. It is possible that ti=iti=i.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers xx and kk: you start on planet xx and travel through kk teleporters.

Output

Print the answer to each query.
