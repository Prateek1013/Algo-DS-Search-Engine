Your task is to construct a minimum-length bit string that contains all possible substrings of length nn. For example, when n=2n=2, the string 00110 is a valid solution, because its substrings of length 22 are 00, 01, 10 and 11.

Input

The only input line has an integer nn.

Output

Print a minimum-length bit string that contains all substrings of length nn. You can print any valid solution.

Constraints

1≤n≤151≤n≤15

Example

Input:
2

Output:
00110
