D. Pair of Topicstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe next lecture in a high school requires two topics to be discussed. The ii-th topic is interesting by aiai units for the teacher and by bibi units for the students.The pair of topics ii and jj (i<ji<j) is called good if ai+aj>bi+bjai+aj>bi+bj (i.e. it is more interesting for the teacher).Your task is to find the number of good pairs of topics.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of topics.The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109), where aiai is the interestingness of the ii-th topic for the teacher.The third line of the input contains nn integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤1091≤bi≤109), where bibi is the interestingness of the ii-th topic for the students.OutputPrint one integer — the number of good pairs of topic.ExamplesInputCopy5
