Chef has KK chocolates and he wants to distribute them to NN people (numbered 11 through NN). These people are standing in a line in such a way that for each ii (1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1), person ii and person i+1i+1 are adjacent.
First, consider some way to distribute chocolates such that for each valid ii, the number of chocolates the ii-th person would receive from Chef is AiAi and the sum S1=∑N−1i=1|Ai−Ai+1|S1=∑i=1N−1|Ai−Ai+1| is minimum possible. Of course, each person must receive a non-negative integer number of chocolates.
Then, Chef wants to create a new sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN by rearranging (permuting) the elements of the sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. For each valid ii, the number of chocolates the ii-th person actually receives from Chef is BiBi. Chef wants to distribute the chocolates (choose B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN by permuting the sequence AA and give BiBi chocolates to the ii-th person for each valid ii) in such a way that S2=∑N−1i=1|Bi–Bi+1|S2=∑i=1N−1|Bi–Bi+1| is maximum possible. You need to find the maximum value of S2S2.
It is guaranteed that S2S2 does not depend on the exact choice of the sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, as long as it is a sequence that minimises S1S1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a single integer KK.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of the sum S2S2.

Explanation
Example case 1: To minimise S1S1, Chef could give 11 chocolate to person 11 and 11 chocolate to person 22, so S1=|1−1|+|1−0|=1S1=|1−1|+|1−0|=1.
To maximise S2S2, Chef can give 11 chocolate to person 11 and 11 chocolate to person 33, since the sequence B=(1,0,1)B=(1,0,1) is a permutation of A=(1,1,0)A=(1,1,0). Then, S2=|1−0|+|0−1|=2S2=|1−0|+|0−1|=2.
