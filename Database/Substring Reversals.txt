Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Given a string, your task is to process operations where you reverse a substring of the string. What is the final string after all the operations?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the length of the string and the number of operations. The characters of the string are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The next line has a string of length nn that consists of characters A–Z.

Finally, there are mm lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers aa and bb: you reverse a substring from position aa to position bb.

Output

Print the final string after all the operations.
