In Uttu's college, a semester is said to be a:

Overload semester if the number of credits taken >65>65.
Underload semester if the number of credits taken <35<35.
Normal semester otherwise

Given the number of credits XX taken by Uttu, determine whether the semester is Overload, Underload or Normal.
Input Format

The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only of each test case contains a single integer XX - the number of credits taken by Uttu.

You may print each character of Overload, Underload and Normal in uppercase or lowercase (for example, ovErLoAd, oVERlOAD, OVERLOAD will be considered identical).
Output Format
For each test case, output Overload, Underload or Normal depending upon the number of credits taken by Uttu.

Normal
Overload
Underload
Normal


Explanation
Test case-1: The semester has 6565 credits. So it is neither an Overload semester nor an Underload semester. So it is a Normal semester.
Test case-2: The semester has 8080 credits (>65>65). So it is an Overload semester.
Test case-3: The semester has 2323 credits (<35<35). So it is an Underload semester.
Test case-4: The semester has 5858 credits. So it is neither an Overload semester nor an Underload semester. So it is a Normal semester.
