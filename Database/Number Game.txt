C. Number Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAshishgup and FastestFinger play a game. They start with a number nn and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:  Divide nn by any of its odd divisors greater than 11.  Subtract 11 from nn if nn is greater than 11. Divisors of a number include the number itself.The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer  — nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109).OutputFor each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).ExampleInputCopy7

NoteIn the first test case, n=1n=1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.In the second test case, n=2n=2, Ashishgup subtracts 11 on the first move. Now n=1n=1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.In the third test case, n=3n=3, Ashishgup divides by 33 on the first move. Now n=1n=1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.In the last test case, n=12n=12, Ashishgup divides it by 33. Now n=4n=4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 11, and Ashishgup gets 33, so he wins by dividing it by 33.
