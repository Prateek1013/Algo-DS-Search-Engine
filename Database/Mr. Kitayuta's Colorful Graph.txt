B. Mr. Kitayuta's Colorful Graphtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. Each edge, namely edge i, has a color ci, connecting vertex ai and bi.Mr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following q queries.In the i-th query, he gives you two integers — ui and vi.Find the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex ui and vertex vi directly or indirectly.InputThe first line of the input contains space-separated two integers — n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100), denoting the number of the vertices and the number of the edges, respectively.The next m lines contain space-separated three integers — ai, bi (1 ≤ ai < bi ≤ n) and ci (1 ≤ ci ≤ m). Note that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are no multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if i ≠ j, (ai, bi, ci) ≠ (aj, bj, cj).The next line contains a integer — q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100), denoting the number of the queries.Then follows q lines, containing space-separated two integers — ui and vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n). It is guaranteed that ui ≠ vi.OutputFor each query, print the answer in a separate line.ExamplesInputCopy4 51 2 11 2 22 3 12 3 32 4 331 23 41 4OutputCopy210InputCopy5 71 5 12 5 13 5 14 5 11 2 22 3 23 4 251 55 12 51 51 4OutputCopy11112NoteLet's consider the first sample.     The figure above shows the first sample.    Vertex 1 and vertex 2 are connected by color 1 and 2.  Vertex 3 and vertex 4 are connected by color 3.  Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not connected by any single color.
