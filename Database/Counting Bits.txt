Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Your task is to count the number of one bits in the binary representations of integers between 11 and nn.

Input

The only input line has an integer nn.

Output

Print the number of one bits in the binary representations of integers between 11 and nn.

Constraints

1≤n≤10151≤n≤1015

Example

Input:
7

Output:
12

Explanation: The binary representations of 1…71…7 are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, and 111, so there are a total of 12 one bits.
