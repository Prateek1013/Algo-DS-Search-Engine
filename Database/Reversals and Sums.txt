Given an array of nn integers, you have to process following operations:

 reverse a subarray
 calculate the sum of values in a subarray

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the size of the array and the number of operations. The array elements are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The next line as nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Finally, there are mm lines that describe the operations. Each line has three integers tt, aa and bb. If t=1t=1, you should reverse a subarray from aa to bb. If t=2t=2, you should calculate the sum of values from aa to bb.

Output

Print the answer to each operation where t=2t=2.
