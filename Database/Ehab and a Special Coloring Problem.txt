C. Ehab and a Special Coloring Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given an integer nn. For every integer ii from 22 to nn, assign a positive integer aiai such that the following conditions hold:  For any pair of integers (i,j)(i,j), if ii and jj are coprime, ai≠ajai≠aj.  The maximal value of all aiai should be minimized (that is, as small as possible). A pair of integers is called coprime if their greatest common divisor is 11.InputThe only line contains the integer nn (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105).OutputPrint n−1n−1 integers, a2a2, a3a3, ……, anan (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy4
OutputCopy1 2 1 InputCopy3
OutputCopy2 1NoteIn the first example, notice that 33 and 44 are coprime, so a3≠a4a3≠a4. Also, notice that a=[1,2,3]a=[1,2,3] satisfies the first condition, but it's not a correct answer because its maximal value is 33.
