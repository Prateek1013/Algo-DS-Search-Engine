Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Find the middle element when the numbers in an n×nn×n multiplication table are sorted in increasing order. It is assumed that nn is odd.

For example, the 3×33×3 multiplication table is as follows:
123246369123246369
The numbers in increasing order are [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9][1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9], so the answer is 33.

Input

The only input line has an integer nn.

Output

Print one integer: the answer to the task.
