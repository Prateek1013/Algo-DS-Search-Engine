A permutation of length N is an array of N integers A=[A1,A2,…,AN] such that every integer from 1 to N appears in it exactly once.
We define a function over a permutation as follows:
F(A)=(A1∗A2)+(A2∗A3)+⋯+(AN−2∗AN−1)+(AN−1∗AN)
You are given an integer N. What is the expected value of the function F over all possible permutations of length N?
The expected value of the function can be represented as a fraction of the form PQ. You are required to print P⋅Q−1(mod1000000007). 
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the expected value of the function modulo 1000000007.

Explanation

Test Case 1: There are 2 possible permutations: A={1,2} with F(A)=2 and A={2,1} with F(A)=2. Hence the expected value of the function is F(A)=12∗2+12∗2=2.
Test Case 2: There are 6 possible permutations, with the value of function as {5,5,8,8,9,9}. Hence the expected value of the function is F(A)=5+5+8+8+9+96=223. The required output will be 333333343, since 333333343⋅3≡22(mod1000000007).
