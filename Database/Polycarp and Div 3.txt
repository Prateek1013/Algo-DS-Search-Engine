D. Polycarp and Div 3time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3.He has a huge number ss. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by 33. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after mm such cuts, there will be m+1m+1 parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by 33.For example, if the original number is s=3121s=3121, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: 3|1|213|1|21. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by 33.Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0'). For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid.What is the maximum number of numbers divisible by 33 that Polycarp can obtain?InputThe first line of the input contains a positive integer ss. The number of digits of the number ss is between 11 and 2⋅1052⋅105, inclusive. The first (leftmost) digit is not equal to 0.OutputPrint the maximum number of numbers divisible by 33 that Polycarp can get by making vertical cuts in the given number ss.ExamplesInputCopy3121OutputCopy2InputCopy6OutputCopy1InputCopy1000000000000000000000000000000000OutputCopy33InputCopy201920181OutputCopy4NoteIn the first example, an example set of optimal cuts on the number is 3|1|21.In the second example, you do not need to make any cuts. The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by 33.In the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits. As a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and 3333 digits 0. Each of the 3333 digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by 33.In the fourth example, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81. The numbers 00, 99, 201201 and 8181 are divisible by 33.
