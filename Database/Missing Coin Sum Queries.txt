You have nn coins with positive integer values. The coins are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Your task is to process qq queries of the form: "if you can use coins a…ba…b, what is the smallest sum you cannot produce?"

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the number of coins and queries.

The second line has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the value of each coin.

Finally, there are qq lines that describe the queries. Each line has two values aa and bb: you can use coins a…ba…b.

Output

Print the answer for each query.
