B. Number Circletime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given nn numbers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. Is it possible to arrange them in a circle in such a way that every number is strictly less than the sum of its neighbors?For example, for the array [1,4,5,6,7,8][1,4,5,6,7,8], the arrangement on the left is valid, while arrangement on the right is not, as 5≥4+15≥4+1 and 8>1+68>1+6.  InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (3≤n≤1053≤n≤105) — the number of numbers.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the numbers. The given numbers are not necessarily distinct (i.e. duplicates are allowed).OutputIf there is no solution, output "NO" in the first line. If there is a solution, output "YES" in the first line. In the second line output nn numbers — elements of the array in the order they will stay in the circle. The first and the last element you output are considered neighbors in the circle. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. You can print the circle starting with any element.ExamplesInputCopy3

OutputCopyNONoteOne of the possible arrangements is shown in the first example: 4<2+34<2+3;2<4+32<4+3;3<4+23<4+2.One of the possible arrangements is shown in the second example.No matter how we arrange 13,8,513,8,5 in a circle in the third example, 1313 will have 88 and 55 as neighbors, but 13≥8+513≥8+5. There is no solution in the fourth example.
