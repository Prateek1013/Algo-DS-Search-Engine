Given an array of nn numbers, your task is to divide it into nn subarrays, each of which has a single element.

On each move, you may choose any subarray and split it into two subarrays. The cost of such a move is the sum of values in the chosen subarray.

What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally?

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the array size. The array elements are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The second line has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum total cost.
