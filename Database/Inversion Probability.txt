Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



An array has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn, and each of them has been randomly chosen between 11 and riri. An inversion is a pair (a,b)(a,b) where a<ba<b and xa>xbxa>xb.

What is the expected number of inversions in the array?

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the size of the array.

The second line contains nn integers r1,r2,…,rnr1,r2,…,rn: the range of possible values for each array position.

Output

Print the expected number of inversions rounded to six decimal places.
