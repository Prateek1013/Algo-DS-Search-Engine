An index ii in a permutation PP of length NN is said to be good if:

PiPi is divisible by i

You are given 2 integers N and K. You need to construct a permutation P of length N such that exactly K indices in that permutation are good.
If no such permutation exists, output −1.
If multiple such permutations exist, output any.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and K - the length of the permutation to be constructed and the number of good indices.

Output Format
For each test case, output any permutation satisfying the given condition.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤N
Sum of N over all testcases does not exceed 2⋅105


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
1 1
6 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
4 5 6 1 2 3


Explanation
Test case-1: In [1], P1=1 is divisible by 1. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 1 good index.
Test case-2: In [4,5,6,1,2,3], P1=4 is divisible by 1 and P3=6 is divisible by 3. Therefore it is a valid permutation having 2 good indices.
