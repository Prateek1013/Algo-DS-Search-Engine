CSES - Increasing Array Queries


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given an array that consists of nn integers. The array elements are indexed 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

You can modify the array using the following operation: choose an array element and increase its value by one.

Your task is to process qq queries of the form: when we consider a subarray from position aa to position bb, what is the minimum number of operations after which the subarray is increasing?

An array is increasing if each element is greater than or equal with the previous element.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the size of the array and the number of queries.

The next line has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Finally, there are qq lines that describe the queries. Each line has two integers aa and bb: the starting and ending position of a subarray.

Output

For each query, print the minimum number of operations.
