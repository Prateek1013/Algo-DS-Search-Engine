Memory limit: 512 MB



Given a set of points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to find the minimum Euclidean distance between two distinct points.

The Euclidean distance of points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) is (x1−x2)2+(y1−y2)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√(x1−x2)2+(y1−y2)2.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of points.

After this, there are nn lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers xx and yy. You may assume that each point is distinct.

Output

Print one integer: d2d2 where dd is the minimum Euclidean distance (this ensures that the result is an integer).
