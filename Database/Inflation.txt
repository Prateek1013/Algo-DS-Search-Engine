B. Inflationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a statistic of price changes for one product represented as an array of nn positive integers p0,p1,…,pn−1p0,p1,…,pn−1, where p0p0 is the initial price of the product and pipi is how the price was increased during the ii-th month.Using these price changes you are asked to calculate the inflation coefficients for each month as the ratio of current price increase pipi to the price at the start of this month (p0+p1+⋯+pi−1)(p0+p1+⋯+pi−1).Your boss said you clearly that the inflation coefficients must not exceed kk %, so you decided to increase some values pipi in such a way, that all pipi remain integers and the inflation coefficients for each month don't exceed kk %.You know, that the bigger changes — the more obvious cheating. That's why you need to minimize the total sum of changes.What's the minimum total sum of changes you need to make all inflation coefficients not more than kk %?InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (2≤n≤1002≤n≤100; 1≤k≤1001≤k≤100) — the length of array pp and coefficient kk.The second line of each test case contains nn integers p0,p1,…,pn−1p0,p1,…,pn−1 (1≤pi≤1091≤pi≤109) — the array pp.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum total sum of changes you need to make all inflation coefficients not more than kk %.ExampleInputCopy2

NoteIn the first test case, you can, for example, increase p0p0 by 5050 and p1p1 by 4949 and get array [20150,50,202,202][20150,50,202,202]. Then you get the next inflation coefficients:   5020150≤11005020150≤1100;  20220150+50≤110020220150+50≤1100;  20220200+202≤110020220200+202≤1100; In the second test case, you don't need to modify array pp, since the inflation coefficients are already good:   11≤10010011≤100100;  11+1≤10010011+1≤100100;
