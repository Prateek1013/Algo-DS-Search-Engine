For the given string S of length N you need to find for each L from 1 to N the first non-palindrome substring of S that has length L. That is, for each L from 1 to N you need to find the smallest positive integer K <= N - L + 1 such that the string S[K, K + L - 1] is not a palindrome. Denote this number by K(L). Here S[i, j] stands for the substring of S composed of its characters in positions i, i + 1, ..., j. Characters of S are numbered from 1 to N. If for some L there is no such K set K(L) = 0. After you find all numbers K(1), K(2), ..., K(N) output the following sum

100007N - 1 * K(1) + 100007N - 2 * K(2) + ... + 100007 * K(N - 1) + K(N)


modulo 264.

Remark. The string is called a palindrome if it coincides with its reverse. So abacaba and abba are palindromes but codechef and abbc are not.
Input
 The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the corresponding sum constructed by numbers K(1), K(2), ..., K(N) as mentioned in the problem statement modulo 264.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 20

1 <= length of S <= 100000

Example
Input:
4
abacaba
abba
codechef
aaaa

Output:
12789123637940213592
10001500056
18134494634143926857
0
Explanation
Actual values of K(1), K(2), ..., K(N) in the tests are:
abacaba: {0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0}
abba: {0, 1, 1, 0}
codechef: {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
aaaa: {0, 0, 0, 0}
