B. A Tide of Riverscapetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output Walking along a riverside, Mino silently takes a note of something."Time," Mino thinks aloud."What?""Time and tide wait for no man," explains Mino. "My name, taken from the river, always reminds me of this.""And what are you recording?""You see it, tide. Everything has its own period, and I think I've figured out this one," says Mino with confidence.Doubtfully, Kanno peeks at Mino's records. The records are expressed as a string ss of characters '0', '1' and '.', where '0' denotes a low tide, '1' denotes a high tide, and '.' denotes an unknown one (either high or low).You are to help Mino determine whether it's possible that after replacing each '.' independently with '0' or '1', a given integer pp is not a period of the resulting string. In case the answer is yes, please also show such a replacement to Mino.In this problem, a positive integer pp is considered a period of string ss, if for all 1≤i≤|s|−p1≤i≤|s|−p, the ii-th and (i+p)(i+p)-th characters of ss are the same. Here |s||s| is the length of ss.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers nn and pp (1≤p≤n≤20001≤p≤n≤2000) — the length of the given string and the supposed period, respectively.The second line contains a string ss of nn characters — Mino's records. ss only contains characters '0', '1' and '.', and contains at least one '.' character.OutputOutput one line — if it's possible that pp is not a period of the resulting string, output any one of such strings; otherwise output "No" (without quotes, you can print letters in any case (upper or lower)).ExamplesInputCopy10 71.0.1.0.1.OutputCopy1000100010InputCopy10 61.0.1.1000OutputCopy1001101000InputCopy10 91........1OutputCopyNoNoteIn the first example, 77 is not a period of the resulting string because the 11-st and 88-th characters of it are different.In the second example, 66 is not a period of the resulting string because the 44-th and 1010-th characters of it are different.In the third example, 99 is always a period because the only constraint that the first and last characters are the same is already satisfied.Note that there are multiple acceptable answers for the first two examples, you can print any of them.
