B. Nirvanatime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKurt reaches nirvana when he finds the product of all the digits of some positive integer. Greater value of the product makes the nirvana deeper.Help Kurt find the maximum possible product of digits among all integers from 11 to nn.InputThe only input line contains the integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1091≤n≤2⋅109).OutputPrint the maximum product of digits among all integers from 11 to nn.ExamplesInputCopy390
OutputCopy216
InputCopy7
OutputCopy7
InputCopy1000000000
OutputCopy387420489
NoteIn the first example the maximum product is achieved for 389389 (the product of digits is 3⋅8⋅9=2163⋅8⋅9=216).In the second example the maximum product is achieved for 77 (the product of digits is 77).In the third example the maximum product is achieved for 999999999999999999 (the product of digits is 99=38742048999=387420489).
