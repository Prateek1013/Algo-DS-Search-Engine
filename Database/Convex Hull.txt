Given a set of nn points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to determine the convex hull of the points.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of points.

After this, there are nn lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers xx and yy: the coordinates of a point.

You may assume that each point is distinct, and the area of the hull is positive.

Output

First print an integer kk: the number of points in the convex hull.

After this, print kk lines that describe the points. You can print the points in any order. Print all points that lie on the convex hull.
