B. Kuriyama Mirai's Stonestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKuriyama Mirai has killed many monsters and got many (namely n) stones. She numbers the stones from 1 to n. The cost of the i-th stone is vi. Kuriyama Mirai wants to know something about these stones so she will ask you two kinds of questions:  She will tell you two numbers, l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and you should tell her .  Let ui be the cost of the i-th cheapest stone (the cost that will be on the i-th place if we arrange all the stone costs in non-decreasing order). This time she will tell you two numbers, l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), and you should tell her . For every question you should give the correct answer, or Kuriyama Mirai will say "fuyukai desu" and then become unhappy.InputThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n integers: v1, v2, ..., vn (1 ≤ vi ≤ 109) — costs of the stones. The third line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of Kuriyama Mirai's questions. Then follow m lines, each line contains three integers type, l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ type ≤ 2), describing a question. If type equal to 1, then you should output the answer for the first question, else you should output the answer for the second one.OutputPrint m lines. Each line must contain an integer — the answer to Kuriyama Mirai's question. Print the answers to the questions in the order of input.ExamplesInputCopy66 4 2 7 2 732 3 61 3 41 1 6OutputCopy24928InputCopy45 5 2 3101 2 42 1 41 1 12 1 42 1 21 1 11 3 31 1 31 4 41 2 2OutputCopy10155155521235NotePlease note that the answers to the questions may overflow 32-bit integer type.
