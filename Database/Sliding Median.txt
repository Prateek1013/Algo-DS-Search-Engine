Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given an array of nn integers. Your task is to calculate the median of each window of kk elements, from left to right.

The median is the middle element when the elements are sorted. If the number of elements is even, there are two possible medians and we assume that the median is the smaller of them.

Input

The first input line contains two integers nn and kk: the number of elements and the size of the window.

Then there are nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Output

Print n−k+1n−k+1 values: the medians.
