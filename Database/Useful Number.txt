You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Let's define the useful number of a subsequence of AA as the number of distinct primes p such that p divides each member of the subsequence, multiplied by the length of the subsequence. Find the maximum of useful numbers of all subsequences of A.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-seperated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the maximum useful number.

Explanation
Example case 1: The subsequence [2,2,4,8] has the maximum useful number. The number of distinct primes that divide each member of the subsequence is 1 (only the prime 2) and the length of the subsequence is 4, so the useful number of this subsequence is 1⋅4=4.
