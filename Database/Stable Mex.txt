Chef gives you a sequence AA of length NN.
Let XX denote the MEX of the sequence A. Chef is interested in the count of positive values k, such that, if every element Ai of A is replaced by max(Ai−k,0), the MEX of the sequence still remains X.
Find the count of such values. If there are infinite such values, print −1 instead.
As a friendly reminder, the MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence. For instance:

The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 because 0 does not belong to the sequence.
The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 because 0 and 1 belong to the sequence, but 2 does not.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the length of the sequence A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case print a single integer — the count of positive values k satisfying the given condition. If there are infinite such values, print −1 instead.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation

Test case 1: There doesn't exist any value of k satisfying the given condition.
Test case 2: There are infinite values of k satisfying the given condition.
Test case 3: There is only 1 value of k satisfying the given condition: k=4. The MEX of the given sequence is 3. When every element Ai of the given sequence is replaced by max(Ai−4,0), the sequence becomes [1,6,0,0,0,2,0], which also has MEX=3.
