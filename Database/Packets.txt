A. Packetstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have nn coins, each of the same value of 11.Distribute them into packets such that any amount xx (1≤x≤n1≤x≤n) can be formed using some (possibly one or all) number of these packets.Each packet may only be used entirely or not used at all. No packet may be used more than once in the formation of the single xx, however it may be reused for the formation of other xx's.Find the minimum number of packets in such a distribution.InputThe only line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109) — the number of coins you have.OutputOutput a single integer — the minimum possible number of packets, satisfying the condition above.ExamplesInputCopy6OutputCopy3InputCopy2OutputCopy2NoteIn the first example, three packets with 11, 22 and 33 coins can be made to get any amount xx (1≤x≤61≤x≤6).  To get 11 use the packet with 11 coin.  To get 22 use the packet with 22 coins.  To get 33 use the packet with 33 coins.  To get 44 use packets with 11 and 33 coins.  To get 55 use packets with 22 and 33 coins  To get 66 use all packets. In the second example, two packets with 11 and 11 coins can be made to get any amount xx (1≤x≤21≤x≤2).
