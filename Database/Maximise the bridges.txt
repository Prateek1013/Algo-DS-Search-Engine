Chef is given two integers N and M. Please help Chef find any connected undirected graph G consisting of exactly N vertices and M edges, such that the number of bridges in G is maximized (among all graphs with N vertices and M edges). G cannot have self-loops or multiple edges.
If there is more than one connected undirected graph with the maximum number of bridges, you may print any one of them.
Note:
A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each testcase consists of a single line of input, containing two integers N,M - the number of vertices and edges of the graph you must construct.

Output Format
For each test case, output M lines where the i-th line contains two space-separated integers denoting the i-th edge of the graph G you constructed. The edges may be printed in any order, and for each edge the endpoints may be printed in any order.
Note that G must not contain self-loops or multiple edges, and no other graph on N vertices and M edges can contain strictly more bridges than G.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
2≤N≤103
N−1≤M≤min(N⋅(N−1)/2,105)
Sum of N over all test cases do not exceed 103
Sum of M over all test cases do not exceed 105

Explanation
Test case 1: There is exactly 1 bridge in the graph and it cannot be increased further.



Test case 2: Since M=N-1 and we are required to output a connected graph, the graph will always be a tree and hence have 4 bridges. Any tree is acceptable here.



Test case 3: Since M= N \cdot (N-1) / 2 our only choice is a complete graph, which has 0 bridges.
