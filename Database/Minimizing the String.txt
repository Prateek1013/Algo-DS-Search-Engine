A. Minimizing the Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string ss consisting of nn lowercase Latin letters.You have to remove at most one (i.e. zero or one) character of this string in such a way that the string you obtain will be lexicographically smallest among all strings that can be obtained using this operation.String s=s1s2…sns=s1s2…sn is lexicographically smaller than string t=t1t2…tmt=t1t2…tm if n<mn<m and s1=t1,s2=t2,…,sn=tns1=t1,s2=t2,…,sn=tn or there exists a number pp such that p≤min(n,m)p≤min(n,m) and s1=t1,s2=t2,…,sp−1=tp−1s1=t1,s2=t2,…,sp−1=tp−1 and sp<tpsp<tp.For example, "aaa" is smaller than "aaaa", "abb" is smaller than "abc", "pqr" is smaller than "z".InputThe first line of the input contains one integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of ss.The second line of the input contains exactly nn lowercase Latin letters — the string ss.OutputPrint one string — the smallest possible lexicographically string that can be obtained by removing at most one character from the string ss.ExamplesInputCopy3
aaa
OutputCopyaa
InputCopy5
abcda
OutputCopyabca
NoteIn the first example you can remove any character of ss to obtain the string "aa".In the second example "abca" < "abcd" < "abcda" < "abda" < "acda" < "bcda".
