A permutation of integers 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 11.

Given nn, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

Input

The only input line contains an integer nn.

Output

Print a beautiful permutation of integers 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".
