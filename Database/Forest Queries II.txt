You are given an n×nn×n grid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or has a tree. Your task is to process qq queries of the following types:
Change the state (empty/tree) of a square.
How many trees are inside a rectangle in the forest?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the size of the forest and the number of queries.

Then, there are nn lines describing the forest. Each line has nn characters: . is an empty square and * is a tree.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "11 yy xx" or "2 y1y1 x1x1 y2y2 x2x2".

Output

Print the answer to each query of the second type.
