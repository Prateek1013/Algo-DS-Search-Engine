Given a tree of nn nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that consist of exactly kk edges.

Input

The first input line contains two integers nn and kk: the number of nodes and the path length. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print one integer: the number of paths.
