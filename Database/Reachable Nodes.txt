CSES - Reachable Nodes


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



A directed acyclic graph consists of nn nodes and mm edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Calculate for each node the number of nodes you can reach from that node (including the node itself).

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of nodes and edges.

Then there are mm lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers aa and bb: there is an edge from node aa to node bb.

Output

Print nn integers: for each node the number of reachable nodes.
