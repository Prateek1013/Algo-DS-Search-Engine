CSES - Pattern Positions


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Given a string and patterns, find for each pattern the first position (1-indexed) where it appears in the string.

Input

The first input line has a string of length nn.

The next input line has an integer kk: the number of patterns. Finally, there are kk lines that describe the patterns.

The string and the patterns consist of characters a–z.

Output

Print the first position for each pattern (or −1−1 if it does not appear at all).

Constraints

1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
1≤k≤5⋅1051≤k≤5⋅105
the total length of the patterns is at most 5⋅1055⋅105
