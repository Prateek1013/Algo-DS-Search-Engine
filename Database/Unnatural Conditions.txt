Given two integers nn and mm, find some positive integers aa and bb such that   s(a)≥ns(a)≥n,  s(b)≥ns(b)≥n,  s(a+b)≤ms(a+b)≤m. InputThe only line of input contain two integers nn and mm (1≤n,m≤11291≤n,m≤1129).OutputPrint two lines, one for decimal representation of aa and one for decimal representation of bb. Both numbers must not contain leading zeros and must have length no more than 22302230.ExamplesInputCopy6 5OutputCopy6 7InputCopy8 16OutputCopy35 53NoteIn the first sample, we have n=6n=6 and m=5m=5. One valid solution is a=6a=6, b=7b=7. Indeed, we have s(a)=6≥ns(a)=6≥n and s(b)=7≥ns(b)=7≥n, and also s(a+b)=s(13)=4≤ms(a+b)=s(13)=4≤m.
