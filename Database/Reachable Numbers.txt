A. Reachable Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's denote a function f(x)f(x) in such a way: we add 11 to xx, then, while there is at least one trailing zero in the resulting number, we remove that zero. For example,   f(599)=6f(599)=6: 599+1=600→60→6599+1=600→60→6;  f(7)=8f(7)=8: 7+1=87+1=8;  f(9)=1f(9)=1: 9+1=10→19+1=10→1;  f(10099)=101f(10099)=101: 10099+1=10100→1010→10110099+1=10100→1010→101. We say that some number yy is reachable from xx if we can apply function ff to xx some (possibly zero) times so that we get yy as a result. For example, 102102 is reachable from 1009810098 because f(f(f(10098)))=f(f(10099))=f(101)=102f(f(f(10098)))=f(f(10099))=f(101)=102; and any number is reachable from itself.You are given a number nn; your task is to count how many different numbers are reachable from nn.InputThe first line contains one integer nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109).OutputPrint one integer: the number of different numbers that are reachable from nn.ExamplesInputCopy1098
