Chef has two integer sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM. You should choose N+M−1N+M−1 pairs, each in the form (Ax,By), such that the sums Ax+By are all pairwise distinct.
It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains M space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BM.

Output
Print N+M−1 lines. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers x and y denoting that you chose a pair (Ax+1,By+1).
Constraints

1≤N,M≤2⋅105
|Ai|≤109 for each valid i
|Bi|≤109 for each valid i
A1,A2,…,AN are pairwise distinct
B1,B2,…,BM are pairwise distinct

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (25 points): 1≤N,M≤103
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

                        Sample Input 1
                        





3 2
10 1 100
4 3



                        Sample Output 1
                        





2 1
0 0
1 0
0 1


Explanation
The chosen pairs and their sums are:

A3+B2=100+3=103
A1+B1=10+4=14
A2+B1=1+4=5
A1+B2=10+3=13

Since all sums are distinct, this is a correct output.
