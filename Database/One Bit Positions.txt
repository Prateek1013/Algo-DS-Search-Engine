Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a binary string of length nn and your task is to calculate for every k between 1…n−11…n−1 the number of ways we can choose two positions ii and jj such that i−j=ki−j=k and there is a one-bit at both positions.

Input

The only input line has a string that consists only of characters 00 and 11.

Output

For every distance kk between 1…n−11…n−1 print the number of ways we can choose two such positions.
