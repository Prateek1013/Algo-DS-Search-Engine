B. Blockstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are nn blocks arranged in a row and numbered from left to right, starting from one. Each block is either black or white. You may perform the following operation zero or more times: choose two adjacent blocks and invert their colors (white block becomes black, and vice versa). You want to find a sequence of operations, such that they make all the blocks having the same color. You don't have to minimize the number of operations, but it should not exceed 3⋅n3⋅n. If it is impossible to find such a sequence of operations, you need to report it.InputThe first line contains one integer nn (2≤n≤2002≤n≤200) — the number of blocks.The second line contains one string ss consisting of nn characters, each character is either "W" or "B". If the ii-th character is "W", then the ii-th block is white. If the ii-th character is "B", then the ii-th block is black. OutputIf it is impossible to make all the blocks having the same color, print −1−1.Otherwise, print an integer kk (0≤k≤3⋅n0≤k≤3⋅n) — the number of operations. Then print kk integers p1,p2,…,pkp1,p2,…,pk (1≤pj≤n−1)(1≤pj≤n−1), where pjpj is the position of the left block in the pair of blocks that should be affected by the jj-th operation.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy8

NoteIn the first example, it is possible to make all blocks black in 33 operations. Start with changing blocks 66 and 77, so the sequence is "BWWWWBBB". Then change blocks 22 and 33, so the sequence is "BBBWWBB". And finally, change blocks 44 and 55, so all blocks are black.It is impossible to make all colors equal in the second example.All blocks are already white in the third example.In the fourth example it is possible to make all blocks white in two operations: first operation is to change blocks 22 and 33 (so the sequence is "BBW"), and then change blocks 11 and 22 (so all blocks are white).
