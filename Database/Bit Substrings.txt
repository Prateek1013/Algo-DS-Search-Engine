Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a bit string of length nn. Your task is to calculate for each kk between 0…n0…n the number of non-empty substrings that contain exactly kk ones.

For example, if the string is 101, there are:

1 substring that contains 0 ones: 0
4 substrings that contain 1 one: 01, 1, 1, 10
1 substring that contains 2 ones: 101
0 substrings that contain 3 ones

Input

The only input line contains a binary string of length nn.

Output

Print n+1n+1 values as specified above.
