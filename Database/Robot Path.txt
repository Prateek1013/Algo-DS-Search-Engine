You are given a description of a robot's path. The robot begins at point (0,0)(0,0) and performs nn commands. Each command moves the robot some distance up, down, left or right.

The robot will stop when it has performed all commands, or immediately when it returns to a point that it has already visited. Your task is to calculate the total distance the robot moves.

Input

The first input line has an integer nn: the number of commands.

After that, there are nn lines describing the commands. Each line has a character dd and an integer xx: the robot moves the distance  xx to the direction dd. Each direction is U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right).

Output

Print the total distance the robot moves.
