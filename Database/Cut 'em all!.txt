The next n−1n−1 lines contain two integers uu, vv (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n) each, describing the vertices connected by the ii-th edge.It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputOutput a single integer kk — the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size, or −1−1 if it is impossible to remove edges in order to satisfy this property.ExamplesInputCopy42 44 13 1OutputCopy1InputCopy31 21 3OutputCopy-1InputCopy107 18 48 104 76 59 33 52 102 5OutputCopy4InputCopy21 2OutputCopy0NoteIn the first example you can remove the edge between vertices 11 and 44. The graph after that will have two connected components with two vertices in each.In the second example you can't remove edges in such a way that all components have even number of vertices, so the answer is −1−1.
