Among all such subsequences, choose the one whose length, kk, is as small as possible. If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.A sequence aa is a subsequence of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements.A permutation of length nn is an array of length nn in which every element from 11 to nn occurs exactly once.InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤2⋅1041≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105) — the length of the permutation pp.The second line of each test case contains nn integers p1p1, p2p2, ……, pnpn (1≤pi≤n1≤pi≤n, pipi are distinct) — the elements of the permutation pp.The sum of nn across the test cases doesn't exceed 105105.OutputFor each test case, the first line should contain the length of the found subsequence, kk. The second line should contain s1s1, s2s2, ……, sksk — its elements.If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.ExampleInputCopy2

NoteIn the first test case, there are 44 subsequences of length at least 22:  [3,2][3,2] which gives us |3−2|=1|3−2|=1.  [3,1][3,1] which gives us |3−1|=2|3−1|=2.  [2,1][2,1] which gives us |2−1|=1|2−1|=1.  [3,2,1][3,2,1] which gives us |3−2|+|2−1|=2|3−2|+|2−1|=2. So the answer is either [3,1][3,1] or [3,2,1][3,2,1]. Since we want the subsequence to be as short as possible, the answer is [3,1][3,1].
