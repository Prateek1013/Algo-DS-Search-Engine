There are NN students standing in a canteen queue, numbered 11 to NN from left to right. For each valid i, the i-th student has a height hi.
Two students i and j can see each other if there are no taller students standing between them. Formally, students i and j (i<j) can see each other if for each integer k (i<k<j), hk≤hi,hj.
For each valid i, determine the number ci of students that have the same height as student i and can be seen by student i.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers h1,h2,…,hN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers c1,c2,…,cN.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤hi≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 103
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

1
5
1 2 2 3 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





0 1 1 0 0


Explanation
Example case 1: Student 3 can see students 2 and 4, but only student 2 has the same height (height 2). On the other hand, student 3 cannot see student 5 since student 4 is taller and therefore blocking the view.
