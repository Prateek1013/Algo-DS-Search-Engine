B. Reach Mediantime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa of nn integers and an integer ss. It is guaranteed that nn is odd.In one operation you can either increase or decrease any single element by one. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the array being equal to ss.The median of the array with odd length is the value of the element which is located on the middle position after the array is sorted. For example, the median of the array 6,5,86,5,8 is equal to 66, since if we sort this array we will get 5,6,85,6,8, and 66 is located on the middle position.InputThe first line contains two integers nn and ss (1≤n≤2⋅105−11≤n≤2⋅105−1, 1≤s≤1091≤s≤109) — the length of the array and the required value of median.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array aa.It is guaranteed that nn is odd.OutputIn a single line output the minimum number of operations to make the median being equal to ss.ExamplesInputCopy3 86 5 8OutputCopy2InputCopy7 2021 15 12 11 20 19 12OutputCopy6NoteIn the first sample, 66 can be increased twice. The array will transform to 8,5,88,5,8, which becomes 5,8,85,8,8 after sorting, hence the median is equal to 88.In the second sample, 1919 can be increased once and 1515 can be increased five times. The array will become equal to 21,20,12,11,20,20,1221,20,12,11,20,20,12. If we sort this array we get 11,12,12,20,20,20,2111,12,12,20,20,20,21, this way the median is 2020.
