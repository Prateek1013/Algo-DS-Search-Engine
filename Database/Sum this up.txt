You are given an array AA with NN positive elements A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You are also given a function S on any array C with length N defined as follow:
S(C) = N∑i=1(Ci−1+Ci+12−Ci)
Note that conventionally, we define all elements outside the range of the array to have value 0. In this context, C0=CN+1=0.
Consider the following process:

Choose a permutation P of values from 1 to N uniformly randomly.
Let B be the array of N elements B1,B2,…,BN, where Bi=APi.

Define V as the expected value of |S(B)|. Find ⌊V⌋.
Note : 

|X| denotes absolute value of X
⌊X⌋ is the greatest integer that does not exceed X.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N integers A1,A2,…,AN - the elements of the array.

Output Format
For each testcase, output ⌊V⌋ in a new line.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤2⋅105

Explanation

Test case 2:
With P=[1,2,3] or P=[1,3,2], we obtain B=[8,2,2], which has |S(B)|=|(0+22−8)+(8+22−2)+(2+02−2)|=5.
With P=[2,1,3] or P=[3,1,2], we obtain B=[2,8,2], which has |S(B)|=|(0+82−2)+(2+22−8)+(8+02−2)|=2.
With P=[2,3,1] or P=[3,2,1], we obtain B=[2,2,8], which has |S(B)|=|(0+22−2)+(2+82−2)+(2+02−8)|=5.

Therefore V=5+5+2+2+5+56=4. We output ⌊V⌋=4.
