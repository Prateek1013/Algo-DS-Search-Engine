CSES - Prüfer Code


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



A Prüfer code of a tree of nn nodes is a sequence of n−2n−2 integers that uniquely specifies the structure of the tree.

The code is constructed as follows: As long as there are at least three nodes left, find a leaf with the smallest label, add the label of its only neighbor to the code, and remove the leaf from the tree.

Given a Prüfer code of a tree, your task is to construct the original tree.

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

The second line contains n−2n−2 integers: the Prüfer code.

Output

Print n−1n−1 lines describing the edges of the tree. Each line has to contain two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb. You can print the edges in any order.
