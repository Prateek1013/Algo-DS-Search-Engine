There are two circles in a plane. The radius of the first circle is R1R1, while the radius of the second circle is R2R2. The coordinates of the centre of the first circle are (X1,Y1)(X1,Y1), while the coordinates the centre of the second circle are (X2,Y2).
Consider all points P with the following properties:

P lies strictly inside the first circle or on its perimeter.
P lies strictly outside the second circle.

Determine whether at least one point with these properties exists. If it exists, find one such point.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers X1, Y1, R1, X2, Y2 and R2.

Output
For each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if there is a point P=(X,Y) with the given properties or "NO" otherwise. If there is such a point, print a second line containing two space-separated real numbers X and Y.
The coordinates X and Y will be considered correct if the distance of the point (X,Y) from the centre of the first circle is at most R1+10−6 and its distance from the centre of the second circle is at least R2−10−6. Note that these conditions are not used to check the existence of the answer, their only purpose is to check the correctness of the coordinates X and Y with floating point precision.
