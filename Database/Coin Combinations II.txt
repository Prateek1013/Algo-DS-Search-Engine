Consider a money system consisting of nn coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to calculate the number of distinct ordered ways you can produce a money sum xx using the available coins.

For example, if the coins are {2,3,5}{2,3,5} and the desired sum is 99, there are 33 ways:
 2+2+52+2+5
 3+3+33+3+3
 2+2+2+32+2+2+3

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and xx: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has nn distinct integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn: the value of each coin.

Output

Print one integer: the number of ways modulo 109+7109+7.
