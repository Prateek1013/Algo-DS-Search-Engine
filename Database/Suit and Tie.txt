Suit and Tietime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAllen is hosting a formal dinner party. 2n2n people come to the event in nn pairs (couples). After a night of fun, Allen wants to line everyone up for a final picture. The 2n2n people line up, but Allen doesn't like the ordering. Allen prefers if each pair occupies adjacent positions in the line, as this makes the picture more aesthetic.Help Allen find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions he must perform to make it so that each couple occupies adjacent positions in the line.InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100), the number of pairs of people.The second line contains 2n2n integers a1,a2,…,a2na1,a2,…,a2n. For each ii with 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, ii appears exactly twice. If aj=ak=iaj=ak=i, that means that the jj-th and kk-th people in the line form a couple.OutputOutput a single integer, representing the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to line the people up so that each pair occupies adjacent positions.ExamplesInputCopy41 1 2 3 3 2 4 4OutputCopy2InputCopy31 1 2 2 3 3OutputCopy0InputCopy33 1 2 3 1 2OutputCopy3NoteIn the first sample case, we can transform 11233244→11232344→1122334411233244→11232344→11223344 in two steps. Note that the sequence 11233244→11323244→1133224411233244→11323244→11332244 also works in the same number of steps.The second sample case already satisfies the constraints; therefore we need 00 swaps.
