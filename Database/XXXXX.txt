Given an array aa, find the length of its longest subarray such that the sum of its elements isn't divisible by xx, or determine that such subarray doesn't exist.An array aa is a subarray of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤5)(1≤t≤5) — the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains 2 integers nn and xx (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105, 1≤x≤1041≤x≤104) — the number of elements in the array aa and the number that Ehab hates.The second line contains nn space-separated integers a1a1, a2a2, ……, anan (0≤ai≤1040≤ai≤104) — the elements of the array aa.OutputFor each testcase, print the length of the longest subarray whose sum isn't divisible by xx. If there's no such subarray, print −1−1.ExampleInputCopy3

NoteIn the first test case, the subarray [2,3][2,3] has sum of elements 55, which isn't divisible by 33.In the second test case, the sum of elements of the whole array is 66, which isn't divisible by 44.In the third test case, all subarrays have an even sum, so the answer is −1−1.
