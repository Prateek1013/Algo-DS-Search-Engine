You are given an integer N. Find another integer X(X>N) such that the following conditions are satisfied :

X is not a multiple of N.
The value  |gcd(N,X)−lcm(N,X)| is as small as possible.

If there are multiple answers for X, print any.
For reference, gcd(u,v) is the greatest common divisor between u and v, while lcm(u,v) refers to the least common multiple.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each testcase, print any suitable X satisfying the above two conditions for the given N.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤1012.
Sum of N over all testcases won't exceed 5∗1012.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (10 points): 2≤N≤1000
Subtask 2 (20 points): 2≤N≤106
Subtask 3 (70 points): 2≤N≤1012

Explanation
1.In first case , GCD(3,4) =1 and LCM(3,4)= 12 , |1−12|= 11. 11 is the smallest value we can get by choosing X as 4.
