A permutation of N distinct integers between 1 and N, both inclusive, is called a prime permutation of size N iff - for all i between 1 and N, the following condition holds:
The ith integer is the Xth smallest integer in the first i integers, where X is either 1 or a prime number.
Your task is to find out how many prime permutations are there of size N.
Input
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing a single integer N.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of prime permutations of size N. Since the answers can be very large, output each answer modulo 1,000,000,007.
Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 500,000
1 ≤ N ≤ 5,000,000
Each input file will not be larger than 4 MB (4,000,000,000 bytes) in size.

WARNING! Large I/O files. Use fast I/O methods.
