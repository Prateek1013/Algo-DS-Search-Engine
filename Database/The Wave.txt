Chef is stuck in the wavey world of polynomials. You are given all NN roots of a polynomial P(x)=∏Ni=1(x−ai)P(x)=∏i=1N(x−ai). The roots are pairwise distinct integers, but they are not given in any particular order.
To help Chef escape, you should answer QQ queries (numbered 11 through QQ). For each valid ii, in the ii-th query, you are given an integer xixi and you have to determine whether P(xi)P(xi) is positive, negative or 00.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
QQ lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single integer xixi describing the ii-th query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE" or "0" (without quotes) describing the value of the polynomial for the ii-th query.
