VK gave a problem to Chef, but Chef is too lazy, so he asked you to solve the problem for him. The statement of the problem follows.
Consider an integer with NN digits (in decimal notation, without leading zeroes) D1,D2,D3,…,DND1,D2,D3,…,DN. Here, D1D1 is the most significant digit and DN the least significant. The weight of this integer is defined as N∑i=2(Di−Di−1).
You are given integers N and W. Find the number of positive integers with N digits (without leading zeroes) and weight equal to W. Compute this number modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and W denoting the number of digits and the required weight.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of N-digit positive integers with weight W, modulo 109+7.

Explanation
Example case 1: Remember that the digits are arranged from most significant to least significant as D1,D2. The two-digit integers with weight 3 are 14,25,36,47,58,69. For example, the weight of 14 is D2−D1=4−1=3. We can see that there are no other possible numbers.
