Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given a tree consisting of nn nodes.

Your task is to determine for each node the maximum distance to another node.

Input

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print nn integers: for each node 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, the maximum distance to another node.
