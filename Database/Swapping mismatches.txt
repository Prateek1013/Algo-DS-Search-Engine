You are given a sequence w of integers. A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w[i] and w[i+1], that w[i]>w[i+1]+1.
As long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.


Input
First - 1<=t<=10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1<=n<=100000. Then, n nonnegative integers.

Output
For each test, you should output exactly n integers.
