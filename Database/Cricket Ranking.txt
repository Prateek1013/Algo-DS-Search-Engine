In a season, each player has three statistics: runs, wickets, and catches. Given the season stats of two players AA and BB, denoted by RR, WW, and CC respectively, the person who is better than the other in the most statistics is regarded as the better overall player. Tell who is better amongst AA and BB. It is known that in each statistic, the players have different values.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line contains three integers R1R1, W1W1, C1C1, the stats for player AA.
The second line contains three integers R2R2, W2W2, C2C2, the stats for player BB.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line "A" (without quotes) if player AA is better than player BB and "B" (without quotes) otherwise.
