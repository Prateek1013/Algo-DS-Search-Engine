D. Even-Odd Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDuring their New Year holidays, Alice and Bob play the following game using an array aa of nn integers:   Players take turns, Alice moves first.  Each turn a player chooses any element and removes it from the array.  If Alice chooses even value, then she adds it to her score. If the chosen value is odd, Alice's score does not change.  Similarly, if Bob chooses odd value, then he adds it to his score. If the chosen value is even, then Bob's score does not change. If there are no numbers left in the array, then the game ends. The player with the highest score wins. If the scores of the players are equal, then a draw is declared.For example, if n=4n=4 and a=[5,2,7,3]a=[5,2,7,3], then the game could go as follows (there are other options):   On the first move, Alice chooses 22 and get two points. Her score is now 22. The array aa is now [5,7,3][5,7,3].  On the second move, Bob chooses 55 and get five points. His score is now 55. The array aa is now [7,3][7,3].  On the third move, Alice chooses 77 and get no points. Her score is now 22. The array aa is now [3][3].  On the last move, Bob chooses 33 and get three points. His score is now 88. The array aa is empty now.  Since Bob has more points at the end of the game, he is the winner. You want to find out who will win if both players play optimally. Note that there may be duplicate numbers in the array.InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array aa.The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the array aa used to play the game.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:   "Alice" if Alice wins with the optimal play;  "Bob" if Bob wins with the optimal play;  "Tie", if a tie is declared during the optimal play.
