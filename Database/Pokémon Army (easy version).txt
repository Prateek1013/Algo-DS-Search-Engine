C1. Pokémon Army (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.Pikachu is a cute and friendly pokémon living in the wild pikachu herd.But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pokémon! Pokémon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pokémon army to resist.First, Andrew counted all the pokémon — there were exactly nn pikachu. The strength of the ii-th pokémon is equal to aiai, and all these numbers are distinct.As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array bb from kk indices such that 1≤b1<b2<⋯<bk≤n1≤b1<b2<⋯<bk≤n, and his army will consist of pokémons with forces ab1,ab2,…,abkab1,ab2,…,abk.The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, ab1−ab2+ab3−ab4+…ab1−ab2+ab3−ab4+….Andrew is experimenting with pokémon order. He performs qq operations. In ii-th operation Andrew swaps lili-th and riri-th pokémon.Note: q=0q=0 in this version of the task.Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pokémon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.Help Andrew and the pokémon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!InputEach test contains multiple test cases.The first line contains one positive integer tt (1≤t≤1031≤t≤103) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and qq (1≤n≤3⋅105,q=01≤n≤3⋅105,q=0) denoting the number of pokémon and number of operations respectively.The second line contains nn distinct positive integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n) denoting the strengths of the pokémon.ii-th of the last qq lines contains two positive integers lili and riri (1≤li≤ri≤n1≤li≤ri≤n) denoting the indices of pokémon that were swapped in the ii-th operation.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅1053⋅105, and the sum of qq over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅1053⋅105. OutputFor each test case, print q+1q+1 integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.ExampleInputCopy3

NoteIn third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be 5−3+7=95−3+7=9.
