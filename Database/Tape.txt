B. Tapetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a long stick, consisting of mm segments enumerated from 11 to mm. Each segment is 11 centimeter long. Sadly, some segments are broken and need to be repaired.You have an infinitely long repair tape. You want to cut some pieces from the tape and use them to cover all of the broken segments. To be precise, a piece of tape of integer length tt placed at some position ss will cover segments s,s+1,…,s+t−1s,s+1,…,s+t−1.You are allowed to cover non-broken segments; it is also possible that some pieces of tape will overlap.Time is money, so you want to cut at most kk continuous pieces of tape to cover all the broken segments. What is the minimum total length of these pieces?InputThe first line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105, n≤m≤109n≤m≤109, 1≤k≤n1≤k≤n) — the number of broken segments, the length of the stick and the maximum number of pieces you can use.The second line contains nn integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤m1≤bi≤m) — the positions of the broken segments. These integers are given in increasing order, that is, b1<b2<…<bnb1<b2<…<bn.OutputPrint the minimum total length of the pieces.ExamplesInputCopy4 100 220 30 75 80OutputCopy17InputCopy5 100 31 2 4 60 87OutputCopy6NoteIn the first example, you can use a piece of length 1111 to cover the broken segments 2020 and 3030, and another piece of length 66 to cover 7575 and 8080, for a total length of 1717.In the second example, you can use a piece of length 44 to cover broken segments 11, 22 and 44, and two pieces of length 11 to cover broken segments 6060 and 8787.
