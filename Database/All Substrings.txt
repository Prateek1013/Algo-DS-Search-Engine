You are given two strings SS and RR. You may reorder the characters in the string RR in any way; let's denote the resulting string by Rr. This reordered string is valid if it contains all substrings of S, i.e. for each substring s of S (including S itself), Rr contains s as a substring.
Find the lexicographically smallest valid reordered string or determine that there is no such valid string.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line contains a single string R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string — the lexicographically smallest valid reordered string, or "Impossible" if there is no such string.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤|S|,|R|≤105
S and R contain only lowercase English letters
the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 106
the sum of |R| over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points):

1≤|S|,|R|≤1,000
S and R contain only the characters 'a' and 'b'
the sum of |S| in all test cases does not exceed 104
the sum of |R| in all test cases does not exceed 104

Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
