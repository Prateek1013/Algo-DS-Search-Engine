Chef Avi is stuck on a not-so-trivial problem. His teacher gave him an array A  of size N and Q queries,each query containing 3 integers X,L,R.
For each query help him find the value of ∑Ri=Lceil(X/Ai), where ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. Note that it is a 1-indexed array.
Input:

First line will contain two integers N and Q.
The next line contains N integers representing the array A. 
Then Q lines follow. 
Each query consists of a single line with three integers: X,L,R. 

Output:
For each query, print the output in a new line.
Constraints

1≤N≤5,00,000
1≤Ai≤1,00,000
1≤Q≤1,000
1≤X≤1,00,000
1≤L≤R≤N

Sample Input:
5 2
7 4 2 9 3
7 2 4
8 1 5

Sample Output:
7
12

Explanation:
For the first query: ceil(7/4)+ceil(7/2)+ceil(7/9) = ceil(1.75)+ceil(3.5)+ceil(0.77) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7.
For the second query: ceil(8/7) + ceil(8/4)+ceil(8/2)+ceil(8/9) + ceil(8/3) = 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 12.
