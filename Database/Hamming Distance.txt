CSES - Hamming Distance


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



The Hamming distance between two strings aa and bb of equal length is the number of positions where the strings differ.

You are given nn bit strings, each of length kk and your task is to calculate the minimum Hamming distance between two strings. 

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and kk: the number of bit strings and their length. 

Then there are nn lines each consisting of one bit string of length kk.

Output

Print the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.
