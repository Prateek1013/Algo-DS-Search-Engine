C. Hexadecimal's Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test64 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne beautiful July morning a terrible thing happened in Mainframe: a mean virus Megabyte somehow got access to the memory of his not less mean sister Hexadecimal. He loaded there a huge amount of n different natural numbers from 1 to n to obtain total control over her energy.But his plan failed. The reason for this was very simple: Hexadecimal didn't perceive any information, apart from numbers written in binary format. This means that if a number in a decimal representation contained characters apart from 0 and 1, it was not stored in the memory. Now Megabyte wants to know, how many numbers were loaded successfully.InputInput data contains the only number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).OutputOutput the only number — answer to the problem.ExamplesInputCopy10OutputCopy2NoteFor n = 10 the answer includes numbers 1 and 10.
