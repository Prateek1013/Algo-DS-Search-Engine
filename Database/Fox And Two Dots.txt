B. Fox And Two Dotstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFox Ciel is playing a mobile puzzle game called "Two Dots". The basic levels are played on a board of size n × m cells, like this:Each cell contains a dot that has some color. We will use different uppercase Latin characters to express different colors.The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same color. Consider 4 blue dots on the picture forming a circle as an example. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:  These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj.  k is at least 4.  All dots belong to the same color.  For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge. Determine if there exists a cycle on the field.InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50): the number of rows and columns of the board.Then n lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of m characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.OutputOutput "Yes" if there exists a cycle, and "No" otherwise.ExamplesInputCopy3 4AAAAABCAAAAAOutputCopyYesInputCopy3 4AAAAABCAAADAOutputCopyNoInputCopy4 4YYYRBYBYBBBYBBBYOutputCopyYesInputCopy7 6AAAAABABBBABABAAABABABBBABAAABABBBABAAAAABOutputCopyYesInputCopy2 13ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZOutputCopyNoNoteIn first sample test all 'A' form a cycle.In second sample there is no such cycle.The third sample is displayed on the picture above ('Y' = Yellow, 'B' = Blue, 'R' = Red).
