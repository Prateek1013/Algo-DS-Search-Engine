A football league of NN teams is taking place, where each team plays other teams once in single round robin fashion. A team gets 33 points for winning a game and 00 for losing (assume that no games end in a draw/tie). What is the maximum possible difference of points between the winning team and the second-placed team?
Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing a single integer NN.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the maximum difference of points between first and second place.
Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
2≤N≤1092≤N≤109

Explanation
Test case 11: There will only be one match played between the two teams, therefore one team wins by 33 points.
Test case 22: Let the three teams be A, B, C. If team A wins both the games against team B and team C, then team A will win by 33 points since one of team B and team C will win the game between them.
Test case 33: Let the four teams be A, B, C, D. One possibility is for A to win all its games, and then B beats C, C beats D, D beats B. This way, the winner has 99 points and second place has 33 points, making a difference of 66.
Test case 44: It can be shown that it's not possible to achieve a difference higher than 1212 when 99 teams play. One way of achieving this is for the winner to score 2424 points and second place to score 1212.
