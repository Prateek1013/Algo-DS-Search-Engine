C. Vladik and fractionstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVladik and Chloe decided to determine who of them is better at math. Vladik claimed that for any positive integer n he can represent fraction  as a sum of three distinct positive fractions in form .Help Vladik with that, i.e for a given n find three distinct positive integers x, y and z such that . Because Chloe can't check Vladik's answer if the numbers are large, he asks you to print numbers not exceeding 109.If there is no such answer, print -1.InputThe single line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104).OutputIf the answer exists, print 3 distinct numbers x, y and z (1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 109, x ≠ y, x ≠ z, y ≠ z). Otherwise print -1.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy3OutputCopy2 7 42InputCopy7OutputCopy7 8 56
