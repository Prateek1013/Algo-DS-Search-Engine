Anas is playing an amazing game on a grid with NN rows and MM columns. The rows are numbered 11 through N from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 through M from left to right.
Anas wants to destroy this grid. To do that, he wants to send two heroes from the top left cell to the bottom right cell:

The first hero visits cells in row-major order: (1,1)→(1,2)→…→(1,M)→(2,1)→(2,2)→…→(2,M)→…→(N,M).
The second hero visits cells in column-major order: (1,1)→(2,1)→…→(N,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→…→(N,2)→…→(N,M).

We know that each hero destroys the first cell he visits, rests in the next K cells he visits without destroying them, then destroys the next cell he visits, rests in the next K cells, destroys the next cell, and so on until he reaches (and rests in or destroys) the last cell he visits.
Anas does not know the value of K. Therefore, for each value of K between 0 and N⋅M−1 inclusive, he wants to calculate the number of cells that will be destroyed by at least one hero. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N⋅M space-separated integers as described above.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N,M≤1,000
the sum of N⋅M over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points):

2≤N,M≤50
the sum of N⋅M over all test cases does not exceed 5,000

Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1:

K=0: All cells will be destroyed by the heroes.
K=1: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(1,3),(2,2)], while the second one will destroy the cells [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)].
K=2: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,1)], while the second one will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,2)].
K=3: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,2)], while the second one will destroy the cells [(1,1),(1,3)].
K=4: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,3)] and the second one will also destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,3)].
K=5 : The first hero will destroy the cell (1,1) and the second one will also destroy the cell (1,1).
