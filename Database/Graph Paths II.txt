Consider a directed weighted graph having nn nodes and mm edges. Your task is to calculate the minimum path length from node 11 to node nn with exactly kk edges.

Input

The first input line contains three integers nn, mm and kk: the number of nodes and edges, and the length of the path. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line contains three integers aa, bb and cc: there is an edge from node aa to node bb with weight cc.

Output

Print the minimum path length. If there are no such paths, print −1−1.
