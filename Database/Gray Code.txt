Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



A Gray code is a list of all 2n2n bit strings of length nn, where any two successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is one).

Your task is to create a Gray code for a given length nn.

Input

The only input line has an integer nn.

Output

Print 2n2n lines that describe the Gray code. You can print any valid solution.
