Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



You are given an n×nn×n grid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or contains a tree. The upper-left square has coordinates (1,1)(1,1), and the lower-right square has coordinates (n,n)(n,n).

Your task is to process qq queries of the form: how many trees are inside a given rectangle in the forest?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and qq: the size of the forest and the number of queries.

Then, there are nn lines describing the forest. Each line has nn characters: . is an empty square and * is a tree.

Finally, there are qq lines describing the queries. Each line has four integers y1y1, x1x1, y2y2, x2x2 corresponding to the corners of a rectangle.

Output

Print the number of trees inside each rectangle.
