D. Array and Operationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa of nn integers, and another integer kk such that 2k≤n2k≤n.You have to perform exactly kk operations with this array. In one operation, you have to choose two elements of the array (let them be aiai and ajaj; they can be equal or different, but their positions in the array must not be the same), remove them from the array, and add ⌊aiaj⌋⌊aiaj⌋ to your score, where ⌊xy⌋⌊xy⌋ is the maximum integer not exceeding xyxy.Initially, your score is 00. After you perform exactly kk operations, you add all the remaining elements of the array to the score.Calculate the minimum possible score you can get.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤5001≤t≤500) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100; 0≤k≤⌊n2⌋0≤k≤⌊n2⌋).The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2⋅1051≤ai≤2⋅105).OutputPrint one integer — the minimum possible score you can get.ExampleInputCopy5

NoteLet's consider the example test.In the first test case, one way to obtain a score of 22 is the following one:  choose a7=1a7=1 and a4=2a4=2 for the operation; the score becomes 0+⌊12⌋=00+⌊12⌋=0, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,3][1,1,1,1,3];  choose a1=1a1=1 and a5=3a5=3 for the operation; the score becomes 0+⌊13⌋=00+⌊13⌋=0, the array becomes [1,1,1][1,1,1];  choose a1=1a1=1 and a2=1a2=1 for the operation; the score becomes 0+⌊11⌋=10+⌊11⌋=1, the array becomes [1][1];  add the remaining element 11 to the score, so the resulting score is 22. In the second test case, no matter which operations you choose, the resulting score is 1616.In the third test case, one way to obtain a score of 00 is the following one:  choose a1=1a1=1 and a2=3a2=3 for the operation; the score becomes 0+⌊13⌋=00+⌊13⌋=0, the array becomes [3,7][3,7];  choose a1=3a1=3 and a2=7a2=7 for the operation; the score becomes 0+⌊37⌋=00+⌊37⌋=0, the array becomes empty;  the array is empty, so the score doesn't change anymore. In the fourth test case, no operations can be performed, so the score is the sum of the elements of the array: 4+2=64+2=6.
