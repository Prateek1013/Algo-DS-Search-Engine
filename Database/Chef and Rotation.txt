Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. For a positive integer MM, sequence BB is defined as B=A∗M that is, appending A exactly M times. For example, If A=[1,2] and M=3, then B=A∗M=[1,2,1,2,1,2]
You have to help him to find out the minimum value of M such that the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence is maximum possible.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum value of M.
Constraints

1≤T≤500
1≤N≤2∗105
1≤Ai≤109
It's guaranteed that the total length of the sequence A in one test file doesn't exceed 2∗106

Explanation
In the first test case, Choosing M=2 gives B=[2,1,2,1] which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length 2 which is the maximum possible.
In the second test case, Choosing M=1 gives B=[1,2] which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length 2 which is the maximum possible.
