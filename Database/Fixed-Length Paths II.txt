Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Given a tree of nn nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that have at least k1k1 and at most k2k2 edges.

Input

The first input line contains three integers nn, k1k1 and k2k2: the number of nodes and the path lengths. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print one integer: the number of paths.
