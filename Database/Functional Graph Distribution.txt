A functional graph is a directed graph where each node has outdegree 11. For example, here is a functional graph that has 99 nodes and 22 components:

Given nn, your task is to calculate for each k=1…nk=1…n the number of functional graphs that have nn nodes and kk components.

Input

The only input line has an integer nn: the number of nodes.

Output

Print nn lines: for each k=1…nk=1…n the number of graphs modulo 109+7109+7.
