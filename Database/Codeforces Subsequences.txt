He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least kk subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string ss is a subset of ten characters of ss that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times: codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome.Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least kk codeforces subsequences.InputThe only line contains a single integer kk (1≤k≤1016)1≤k≤1016).OutputPrint a shortest string of lowercase English letters that contains at least kk codeforces subsequences. If there are several such strings, print any of them.ExamplesInputCopy1
