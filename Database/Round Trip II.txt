Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Byteland has nn cities and mm flight connections. Your task is to design a round trip that begins in a city, goes through one or more other cities, and finally returns to the starting city. Every intermediate city on the route has to be distinct.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then, there are mm lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is a flight connection from city aa to city bb. All connections are one-way flights from a city to another city.

Output

First print an integer kk: the number of cities on the route. Then print kk cities in the order they will be visited. You can print any valid solution.

If there are no solutions, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
