Given the rating RR of a person, tell which division he belongs to. The rating range for each division are given below:

Division 11: 2000≤2000≤ Rating.
Division 22: 1600≤1600≤ Rating <2000<2000.
Division 33: Rating <1600<1600.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, which contains a single integer RR.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the answer: 11 if the person belongs to Division 11, 22 if the person belongs to Division 22, and 33 if the person belongs to Division 33.

Explanation
Test case 11: Since the rating of the person lies in the range [1000,1600)[1000,1600), he belongs to Division 33.
Test case 22: Since the rating of the person lies in the range [2000,4500][2000,4500], he belongs to Division 11.
Test case 33: Since the rating of the person lies in the range [1600,2000)[1600,2000), he belongs to Division 22.
