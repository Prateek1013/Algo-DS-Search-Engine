C. Paint the Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers. You have to choose a positive integer dd and paint all elements into two colors. All elements which are divisible by dd will be painted red, and all other elements will be painted blue.The coloring is called beautiful if there are no pairs of adjacent elements with the same color in the array. Your task is to find any value of dd which yields a beautiful coloring, or report that it is impossible.InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains one integer nn (2≤n≤1002≤n≤100) — the number of elements of the array.The second line of each testcase contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10181≤ai≤1018).OutputFor each testcase print a single integer. If there is no such value of dd that yields a beautiful coloring, print 00. Otherwise, print any suitable value of dd (1≤d≤10181≤d≤1018).ExampleInputCopy5
