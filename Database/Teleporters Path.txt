CSES - Teleporters Path


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



A game has nn levels and mm teleportes between them. You win the game if you move from level 11 to level nn using every teleporter exactly once.

Can you win the game, and what is a possible way to do it?

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of levels and teleporters. The levels are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

Then, there are mm lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is a teleporter from level aa to level bb.

You can assume that each pair (a,b)(a,b) in the input is distinct.

Output

Print m+1m+1 integers: the sequence in which you visit the levels during the game. You can print any valid solution.

If there are no solutions, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
