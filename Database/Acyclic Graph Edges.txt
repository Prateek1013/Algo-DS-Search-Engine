CSES - Acyclic Graph Edges


Time limit: 1.00 s
Memory limit: 512 MB



Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that the resulting directed graph is acyclic.

Input

The first input line has two integers nn and mm: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.

After this, there are mm lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers aa and bb: there is an edge between nodes aa and bb.

Output

Print mm lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integers aa and bb: there is an edge from node aa to node bb. You can print any valid solution.
